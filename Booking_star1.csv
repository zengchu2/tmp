Host would not respond to any form of communication and booking.com wouldn’t release me from the reservation, they insisted I arrive and not have a room before they would help. This is literally the reason why I booked ahead, to avoid the problem they are making me deal with. Little to no help on the service line, they will always tell you 24-48 hours and that they’ll call back but they don’t and they don’t take any action after 24-48 hours they just start the time period over.",1,0,en,Bookingstar1

We spoke to the owner of the building and he confirmed this. We tried to get in touch with the fake owner but they didnt reply. Then we reached out to Booking.com through their form on the website (multiple times!) but they did not get back to us straight away so we had to find another solution as it was already evening, which made it super stressful! When we got back we reached out to Booking again and ever since we have been in an endless discussion with them as they don't believe the place doesn't exist, even though we have send proof. They said they got in touch with the apartment and that the apartment confirmed they were able to properly accommodate us and that after our checkout Booking.com is not able to help us anymore.

10,Jacqueline Verweij,unknown,2022-06-06T14:24:10.000Z,Booking.com has become a scam company,"Booking.com has become a scam company. I have used booking.com many times in the past, but I do not know if they changed ownership or management, but they have changed for the worse. Their helpline is only there to create a buffer between management and customers. Emails are not answered. We had a booking and suddenly a week later and 2 weeks before our departure they cancelled. Booking said they had tried to contact us because the wrong rate had been applied. I was never contacted but they said they tried to contact us on the app. I do not have the app. These people have my email address and up till then they sent everything to my email address. There was no way I got any communication.And then to change the rate a week later? When I was in touch with the owner the rate had not changed. I just would not get the Booking discount. Not much of a discount if they hold onto 1300 E. The owner says that Booking cancelled and Booking said the owner cancelled. I was on the phone several times with Customer NON service people who are no doubt nice girls who are doing Booking's dirty work. They cannot and will not let you speak to any management. I suspect Booking uses the cash they hold onto for their own purposes as an interest free loan. 7 to 12 days before one gets a refund. In this day and age when money can be transferred across borders within minutes. Really? I also read on other reviews one is lucky to get a refund at all. I will only use Booking as in info website and then go to the property direct. BAD BAD service. DO NOT USE.",1,0,en,Bookingstar1

This because of the flight we had to change.... To our surprise there was a problem with the booking. The rate applied to our booking only applies to UK citizens and not to Dutch citizens. In order to check-in I had to leave a large deposit to the check-in desk. According to the employee of Cleopatra Resort, the problem would have been solved in the morning.Unbelievable, what a nice way to start our holidays!To keep a long story short: I have been in touch each day of my staying with the local customer care by persons and of lastminute.com. I have been able to find out that the booking at the hotel had been made by the local office of Sun International on request of Jumbo Travel in Spain based on the booking I had made on Lastminute.com using the link on booking.com........ That sounds quite complex to me but why am I confronted with all of this.I have spent a lot of money calling the customer center of lastminute.com from Egypt. It costs you about 10 dollars only to go through the choices on the phone (they do not offer support via e-mail of chat). Unbelievable!And once I have manage to speak to someone all they could say is that I had to wait. Even when I came back home, the only thing I have heard from lastminute.com support is that I HAD TO WAIT.....well... I have been waiting since Februari now and I still did not get a reply.SHAME ON YOU: lastminute.com, booking.com and Cleopatra resort.Unless you want to ruin your holidays: stay away from lastminute.com (direct of via the link on boking.com)",1,0,en,Bookingstar1

No confirmation email so tried to call customer services and email them. Automated voice on customer services literally says she can’t talk to you without a confirmation number. So it took a whole day of back and forth emails with people that honestly did not have a clue what they were doing and who did NOT understand the fact that NO I HAVENT GOT A CONFIRMATION NUMBER!!! Finally after about 4-5 hours of back and forth emails explaining my situation, they explained that it didn’t go through but the money will be refunded. Now, this was in MARCH! I’ve called twice and complained, constantly being told ‘oh it’s coming from Amsterdam so might take awhile ring your bank’ absolute BULL! This company is refusing to refund me £130 for a holiday that didn’t even book and I didn’t go on.

13,Shelby,unknown,2022-06-06T02:30:36.000Z,Awful customer service,"I booked to stay with City Lifestyle with booking.comOn booking it said to call the property if you were to be checking in late. I emailed them to let them know on booking, then called twice. No one answered or replied to my email. I then got to the property late at night after a flight hoping for the best. However when I got there, there were no instructions for what to do. The door was locked to the building and the hostel was on a different floor. I called the number on the door, someone did answer and said to wait for someone to let me in. After convincing someone, she did let me in, however she was on a different floor so I then had to wait for someone to actually let me onto the right level. This took quite a long time and was quite stressful. Once I finally got to the reception floor, I requested to get the keys out of the lockbox, however the man on the phone demanded a $100 deposit over the phone. I had paid in full prior to arriving and this was no where to be found on the website - I explained that I did not have a card capable of doing so, so in the morning I could pay him in cash or with my Eftpos card. He said no, that I could get cash out now. It was about 10:30pm, and if I were to get cash out it would have required me to again leave the building and try get back in. Plus - if he wasn't there, where the heck was I going to leave the cash anyway? I explained to him that I had given notice that I was going to be late and no one had gotten back to me, so if we could please just let me in my room and we can sort it out in the morning. The man refused, so I said well I guess I can't stay here because if I leave, I can't get back in. He was extremely rude about the entire situation and told me to talk with Booking.com as I requested a refund. So far, I have called Booking.com multiple times and no one has been able to get me an answer, with City Lifestyle labelling me in their system as a ""no show"" therefore I'm ineligible for a refund. It's utter nonsense and lead to me being alone late at night in Melbourne with no where to stay. I have called Booking.com multiple times and emailed them but have had absolutely no luck getting a resolution. The agents I've spoken with can't even speak English and had no idea what my issue was in the first place. One of the agents I spoke to put me on hold after I explained the situation, then she came back on to ask me ""if I stayed there"" ... I was like ... the entire point of the story was that they didn't let me in to stay and now apparently I'm a no show, so no. I did not stay.",1,0,en,Bookingstar1

Booked accommodation 1.3 miles from the Olympic Park for 4 nights at the Commonwealth Games last November. It was for the Central Stratford Cozy and was so looking forward to a wonderful weekend of sport especially the cycling. Out of the blue I received an email today saying that the booking has been cancelled due to overbooking!! An alternative address was given, 23 miles away, and having to share a bathroom. How on Earth could this happen after booking so far in advance? I suspect that they can now get a higher price and so have took a booking that pays more and so got rid of mine. I actually went on the site and my room is available for 1 night only at double the price if multiplied by 4 nights! Say no more!When I contacted the hotel they told me I was still booked in but that has now changed.

I travelled to Alicante Spain during April and stayed in Amorales Luxury Beachfront Apartments.  I was granted a refund of 186.43 from the property owner because the swimming pool in the complex was closed for our entire stay. The refund was to be refunded by booking.com as I had used them to make the reservation, this was well over a month ago and I still have not received it.  I phoned Booking.com five times, was placed on hold for an average of 20 minutes each time and only to discover after 37 minutes that there is nothing they can do to help resolve this. They keep giving me the run around blaming their finance department I feel as though they are trying to make me give up on receiving the refund so they can keep it. The customer service is horrific, please stay well away from this company.

I went so my daughter could have a play date. I was supposed to relax and chill. Checked in at Ocean Resort had upfront parking. Hotel wasn’t what the image appeared, but I was willing to over look that. At the time of the booking it said they had vending machines not just soda machines and breakfast lies and more lies. I stayed in my room and didn’t move my car. Ooh the pool was indoor but out the door and the temperature wasn’t right. Too cold to be an indoor pool. So when my fault and her friend came to me  cause she stayed in another hotel we decided to go to an arcade. We walked. Well my son and I stepped out to get some air for a second and noticed a car that looked like mine being towed down the street. And I read the tags. It was my car. I was furious. I had to stop what I was doing and run back to the hotel. I get there and ask why? They say I didn’t have a parking permit. I tell them they never gave me one run the camera back . And they see I’m not lying call the tow truck and say it’s going to cost me for him to bring it back. I say have you lost your mind. You stole my car.!!! I did nothing wrong. This is your negligence.

I called booking.com today (which took me over an hour trying to find out how to actually get ahold of someone) and when someone answered all I could hear was background noise. It sounded like there was a party going on. I was asked if there was a way he can move into another room and he told me he couldn't. I then explained to him the situation and that my bank has been trying to contact them for over a month and has not heard anything back from them. He told me that there was nothing he could do. I explained to him that my bank needs to get a hold of them and he kept telling me there is nothing they could do. I asked to speak to a manager.

They were unable to contact the hotel to change the reservation and asked if I could wait and they would get back to me. I asked if I could at least change the card but was told to wait and make the changes. They confirmed that I would NOT be charged that day at 5, and that I had until the day before check in. I agreed. 2 hours later at 5 my card was charged. I called again, and was told that nothing could be done. I was out the money and that thier system did this automatically. I asked to speak to anohter rep, and they disconnnected the call. 4 hours of calling and waiting they told me that they could give me refund but that i would loose the reservation, now days away from my trip (all the hotels were booked up at this point and the few available room in the town were 4x the amount i had made my reservation for. I asked if we could contact the hotel and explain the situation, if my reservation was canceled, why couldnt I rebook the same room at the same rate? They told me they still could not get in touch with my hotel (this went on for 8 hours). The hotel told me that i had to deal with booking.com since the reservation went through them. The rep argued with me that i recieved an email about being charged days early, but I insisted that was not what my confirmation email said, and conintued to show them what the other reps wrote me assuring me I would not be charged. They told me that the system works on Amsterdam time. I am in Texas as I the hotel I booked at. No where is this listed noted. However this is a moot point as they still charged me days earlier then agreed, even with ""Amersterdam"" time. The customer srvice was nice until they had my money and then they were unheloful and rude, In total I spoke with 6 different reps. I finally was transferred (after asking and calling for hours) to a manager and then the call was disconnected (again). At that same moment I got an email from the manager offereing me $20 for my trouble and stating they could do my request. By then I had noted that english was the second language and our conversations were going in circles. so I asked for clarification on what was to be done. Nothing was to be done. They could refund my money and I would have to find another room and cover the increased costs, they were not going to try and help me. I was told to accept what is. In exasperation I told them to refund my money and then was told it would be over two weeks before i saw the refund. They emptied my bank account days before my trip, lied to me, gave me wrong information, refused to do anything about it. I contacted the hotel myself and they gave me my room back at a rate that is $25 more a night, but the rate days before my trip was double what is what when I booked a month ago so I considered myself lucky that the hotel had better customer service then booking.com. Also, the refused to honor the $20 aploogy in the end stating they should not have offered it to me. This all went down while i was attending bridal shower, which i basically missed because i was on the phone the entire time and several hours after. Friends who heard parts of my calls starting offering me a roll away at thier hotel. That is kind but it was embarrassing and the focus was on my booking.com problem and not the bride. I will never use Booking.com again, they are dishonest, do not honor what they advertise or tell you in writing, they cost me a day of my time, and $100 for a new room, not to mention the stress of the entire situation.",1,1,en,Bookingstar1

I had used them for years with few issues but my recent experience has put me off using them for life. Myself and two other guests were visiting London for Comic Con, we had booked an apartment ten minutes away for convenience. We left the event early, to travel to our accommodation and I had a call from the Landlord (who was incredibly dismissive and rude) notifying me that the booking had been cancelled (something that we had heard nothing about at this point) and to contact booking.com. We were at the train station on the way to the accommodation with luggage, now stranded in London with nowhere to go.I contacted booking.com and was told that the accommodation has been double booked, they apologised and told me they'd provide me with an alternative option within 30 minutes. 90 minutes went by with no contact. I called back again and spoke to someone new, who had informed me they sent an email to the Landlord and hadn't called me back because they were waiting for a response. Subsequently they cancelled the booking and issued me a refund (which would take 10-12 days to process).I was told I would receive an alternate option for accommodation at the same price point, that concept was ridiculous as we had booked the accommodation in advance and there was no way you'll find accommodation at the same price, in London, the day of the event. After a further 30 minutes, we were sent an option on the completely opposite side of London, in a low rated hotel for one room.We declined this option and asked for alternatives closer to the event venue and had no further correspondence from booking.com, until 2 days later when we got sent the same option again by a different colleague (two days after the booking date).To say that I am disappointed with this company... is an understatement.

I had an apartment booked and, as always with Booking com had paid in advance . We arrived at the agreed time but couldn't gain access. I accessed the Booking. com site and it stated under check in instructions ""key collection takes place at the property' . Need more details contact the owner'. I tried she wasn't responding and in desperation I contacted Booking.com. After a lengthy wait and then explaining my situation, the representative said she would try and return my call within 15 mins. She never did.Ten minutes later I received a message from the owner asking if I needed a permit. I responded immediately stating we couldn't gain access and had been stood outside the property for 20 minutes. She ignored my text. Realising she wasn't going to respond I again spent 15 minutes attempting to make contact with booking.com, eventually speaking with a representative who also failed to provide the information on their system regarding access. After a lengthy discussion and me requesting to speak with a manager I was placed on hold for 10 minutes before he came back to me, confirmed I would receive a full refund and it would be returned to my bank account within 12 days. I asked him to confirm for clarity and he did. Hours had now passed  It was a Friday evening on one of the busiest weekends in Cheltenham but we eventually managed to find a hotel for 1 night and then move to another . As we were collecting our keys at the hotel the owner contacted us. She said she had previously sent a mail with instructions but I told her I could not see it, however, Booking.com site says key collection takes place at the property.  She had no idea why Booking com stated that or why they had not provided the information. I confirmed we had now paid for a hotel. She accepted this but, according to Booking.com, she informed them we had now accessed the property. Following lengthy correspondence yesterday, I received various mails from Booking com stating they are unwilling to honour the agreement they made to refund my money as they only record their calls for training purposes so I have no proof!! My request for a senior manager to call me was refused. I was told I had to telephone the call centre and request to speak with a supervisor . I have received apologies for the way it was handled and confirmation they could have provided me with the code to access the property. They have the calls recorded for training purposes and my authority to use them but have now blocked my calls.

The company is called SoBeNY/ trading as ‘Corphousing Group’ and the accommodation is ‘Boston West Accommodations’ in Massachusetts.We booked 7 nights at this accommodation in Boston, via Booking.com and paid in full upon booking in January 2022.Fast forward 5 months, we arrive in Boston and have our booking cancelled late afternoon, leaving us high and dry in an unfamiliar city (we are from the UK). SoBeNY and Booking.com both subsequently failed to engage, answer the phone or return messages. Since this happened to us, we have researched the Corphousing Group and found that numerous people had the same experience and Booking.com failed to take any action or remove this scam from its website. Of course, you can only write a review if you actually stay at the venue, so beware that all you will see is positive reviews for Boston West Accommodations - you are not seeing anything from those who were scammed like us. The fact that Booking.com continue to endorse this company despite knowing the problems is disgraceful.SoBeNY/ Corphousing Group will make you feel they are legitimate and are quick to respond to messages initially. For example, I was in contact right up until arriving in Boston 3 hours prior and they said they would send us all the details and looked forward to welcoming us.As soon as we arrived at Boston and again asked for the apartment details, we received the following message from SoBeNY/ Corphousing Group via the Booking.com messaging portal:“ Urgent Notification about your upcoming reservation-Thank you for your interest in staying with us. SobeNY prides itself in providing the very best experience for each of our guests. Presently we are experiencing a problem with the property and/or listing you sought to book, and are unable to provide the experience we would have hoped to provide. We are in the midst of several software transitions to improve our guest's experience and are still working through the kinks. Unfortunately, we need to cancel your upcoming reservation. We sincerely apologize for this inconvenience.”No refund has been received and we had to pay extortionate price to stay somewhere else at late notice. Booking.com have completely failed to respond to any messages.If I had been a solo female traveller or a vulnerable person, this could have been an extremely dangerous situation.BE AWARE - BOOKING.COM IS NOT A SAFE SITE TO USE EVEN IF YOU HAVE HAD NO PREVIOUS PROBLEMS.

Their system adjusted the pick up time which I did not notice at the time of confirmation. It was a significant difference in time. The flight was landing after 7pm and their system marked the pick up time as 12noon. A day before travel realised the time, tried amending to no avail. Customer service was appalling. The first representative cut me off without leaving a note on the system. The second person did not cancel the booking after agreeing that's the only way getting out of this without pumping more money to their business. She refused to put the call through to the management. I lost the car, money and they did not refund the full amount even though it was their fault. A complaint was sent directly to Booking.com but had no reply. Since this situation I searched for reviews and complaints people made. See it for yourself. There is plenty of evidence out there, so don't book through them. When you will experience issues with any type of booking, they will never get resolved. Stay away!",1,0,en,Bookingstar1

I then noticed the booking cheaper on another platform, so enquired about Booking.com's Price Promise - which seemed pretty clear 'find the same room somewhere else cheaper and they'll refund the difference'.So I had two choices: cancel with Booking.com (I was still within the cancellation period without incurring charges) and book with Hotels.com and make a significant saving, or stay with Booking.com and ask them to refund the difference. Unfortunately I made the wrong choiceThe first excuse for not refunding my money was that the rooms were different. They are not, I sent details of both rooms, including the square footage.The second excuse is that the rooms are the same price. Having sent screenshots showing different prices, I'm baffled. Their latest excuse is the the prices are different, their response below:'We were not able to process your claim because the cancelation policy and the price on the reservation that you have shown to us are different from the one on our website'. I'm not really sure what this means - the prices are different it's why I want a refund. Seems pretty simple to me, had I cancelled with Booking.com I'd have made a huge saving.

Considering that we live in New York, we relied on the pictures posted on Booking’s website, and the perception of their quality control of properties listed on their website. We flew to Miami and went to the Apartment where we were supposed to stay for one week. Getting out of elevator, we saw a notice that the building will not have water the whole day on the following day. The corridor was under renovation and being freshly painted. The whole floor was suffocating with the smell of fresh paint. As we entered the apartment, we realized that the air conditioner is not working properly and there are notices that the air conditioner must be running all the time. There were a few stand-alone large fans located in different rooms. As I checked the kitchen, I noticed black molds in the top corner and when I paid attention I also noticed black molds around air conditioner’s ducts covered by a sloppy paint job. This residence was not livable at the current condition, and the owner’s disregard for the health of renters was quite astonishing. I took videos and pictures from all areas and sent them to Booking.com. Considering that one of my children has asthma, we left the apartment immediately and booked another place thru Booking. As I contacted Booking, provided all the pictures and videos, and complained they did not show any sense of responsibility for the mess they put us in. Booking did not refund us for the any of reservations, made profit twice thru two bookings we made, and did not at least apologize for their lack of reliability, and negligence.

I've been using this hotel booking platform for years now and I never had any problems with it till now. My friends and I have booked 9 different hotels for our Euro trip this July that costed us about AED 15,000 or roughly about USD 4000 in total. One property by the name of Casa Lit Barcelona by Ona Hotels have been declining my card due to invalid credit card details. Which I have updated 3x and every time it says confirmed, then surprisingly after my 3rd attempt the booking says it was cancelled and I may need to book again. I would love to do that again if the price didn't triple the initial booking amount. We tried to send the property an email right after but no response at all. It's just funny how the other 8 bookings were confirmed except for this one hotel.Since we wanted to re-instate the booking. We tried to call their call center number and have spoken to 3 agentsThe first one was a lady who can't even construct a full English sentence, who put me on hold for 3x with 10 -20 minutes each. I asked for a Supervisor or a Manager on duty and she blatantly said we don't have one, we can't transfer you and we cant help you anymore. Until she pretended that she cant hear me and drop the call making it look that I was not there on the other line. The call lasted for an hour, give or take. After a few minutes, I called again and spoke to a guy name Kenneth. I asked him if he can give me the lady's name who I spoke with minutes back. He then put me on hold and came back saying due to security reasons he will be unable to provide the agent's name. Which was weird as they always say their names when receiving the call. I told him I need to escalate an issue and would love to speak to a Supervisor. He said unfortunately no one is available but he will look for one and put me on hold. Then the call was dropped. It was also funny for him to tell me that since this property is non refundable, we will not refund your money. Hello? my booking was canceled because my card was declined, with that being said there will be no charges or refund to be made. The call lasted for about 30 minutes.Then I called again and speak to another guy and I didn't get the name. I told him I need to speak to a Supervisor to complain, or if he can give me contact details like an email or a link to submit a complaint. He said we don't have one. He also explained that they don't have any Supervisor, and Supervisors do not speak to clients but he can take down my complaint, escalate and process it internally. Hopefully it was done. At the end nothing was done on the booking I was complaining, as they said it cannot be retrieved as the property have cancelled it. He said if I want it I may need to book it with the new price. He even offered me a EUR 20 as a goodwill gesture of the inconvenience, which I declined. I hope that the Management of booking.com sees this and investigate the issue. I am extremely disappointed and furious how these staffs have handled my concern. First the action of the property was very unprofessional and two the actions of their so called 'face of the company' or staff needs more training on how to properly assist, help and escalate customers queries or concerns.We are now thinking of canceling all the hotel bookings that we have and might use Agoda for our hotel bookings, and more likely will never use this booking app ever again.",1,1,en,Bookingstar1

Then my husband and I decided we couldn't go - we just needed to save rather than spend. So, via the Booking.com app, I carefully cancelled the trip within the 'free cancellation' period. The App now said that the trip was 'Cancelled', and I double-checked this to be sure. I assumed (of course) that Booking.com would notify the hotel. So I was shocked and not happy when on 30th April I noticed that the hotel had taken £100 from my bank account because we hadn't arrived for our stay.Checking the app, I was also shocked to see that the Milan booking status had changed from 'Cancelled' back to 'Confirmed' - so the hotel clearly had been expecting us.Immediately I emailed the hotel to tell them that I had cancelled with Booking.com a few days ago (no reponse from the hotel) and called Booking.com to explain the situation and ask for a refund. I spoke to an agent called Ti Moni D. who said that there was a problem with the app and that I would be refunded within 24 hours. She then messaged the hotel to request a cancellation - which is the worst thing she could have done as our first night had already past, and this just made me look like a no-show rather than someone who had ALREADY cancelled via the flipping Booking.com app. I'm furious that she also made no note on my account, post our call, that she'd confirmed there was a problem with the app and promised me a refund. Very bad service. Over the next few days (and six calls I made to Booking.com, explaining things over and over to new agents -  you know how it goes) I was told by various agents that the hotel would reimburse me (it didn't - and why should it? The fault was with the Booking.com app). Meanwhile, Booking.com kept evading by insisting the hotel should pay, or by promising calls or a refund they didn't deliver).  One agent also said that I should give them proof that I had cancelled by providing their 'confirmation of cancellation' email - but I hadn't looked out for it as the app had so clearly said the booking was cancelled. I trusted this and so hadn't thought twice about it.So overall, lost £100 because of Booking.com's faulty app and bad policy, leaving me disappointed and frustrated.",1,0,en,Bookingstar1

So we had no choice but to take the twin room, depsite this being a romantic getaway. (The room was an absolute hole but that's another story).The following morning, we spoke to reception who said that we were welcome to check out and request a refund from booking.com for the two nights we didn't stay there on the grounds of not getting the room that we had paid for, and that they would absolutely approve the refund.We went to another hotel and paid directly (not through booking.com) and had a lovely weekend.One return I sent everything through to customer service and requested the refund. I am now about 10 email and responses later, and each email I send is responded to with more going round in circles, asking me for proof of the room type I booked (which of course is not on their confirmation, clearly done on purpose), querying the invoice, asking for a full breakdown of what i paid (including food?!) or for strange other evidence which woulnd't be appopriate. But it's all done in a weirdly friendly conversational tone. I honestly feel like I'm getting gaslighted.For the sake of my own mental health I have decided not to pursue the refund further and chalk it up to bad experience.It was almost a relief to come on here and see all the other reviews and realise that it's not just me. Also pertinent to note that there is not a single reply fro booking.com to any of their bad reviews, which I think says it all really that they just don't care.I am very lucky however that I am only down a few hundred pounds, I have read reviews on here from people who are down thousands or who had much worse expereinces.

We contacted Booking.com and they explained to us that those movements could be to check if the card is a valid one and the money is just on hold. The day after we realised the money really went out of our account and we contacted Booking.com again and they said neither them or the hotel are responsible for that transactions. We contacted our card issuer and they told us the €48,76 (with a descripiton ""Paysend EU"") is actually returning back to our account but the €100,00 (with a description ""Wester Union"") is not. We managed to contact Western Union and they said the transaction was made by some Valentin Batalyuk and it must be fraud related.

I am now incredibly depressed and struggling to get my life back on track. So I booked a Holiday for us as a group of friends. When I booked i booked two rooms. At the time of booking both rooms said “cancellation free, no payment needed until stay”. So I booked. Then 4 days before Christmas £600 came out of my bank. Which meant I had no money for the rest of of my Xmas presents. I have a two year old and hadn’t even finished my Christmas shopping. This really pushed me over the edge. Whenever I spoke to booking.com they said that I booked a nine refundable room. No I DID NOT!!!! None of my friends had the money to send me which was obviously gutting for me as I had to pay the full amount on my ownI left it. Then a month before we went, although I had already paid the full amount another £600 came out of my bank. Despite me already paying the full amount at Christmas!!!!!!!!! This meant I went over drawn in my bank, had no money for food, petrol or anything. I got charged by my bank Every day. It took two weeks to get it back into my bank. And when I did they refunded me less because of the exchange rate. Now I cannot get back any of the money that has been missed from my bank and from the exchange rate issue. I didn’t enjoy the holiday at all. And this has caused my mental health to decline. Every time I try and talk to them about it they tell me I had my refund etc etc. They are not understanding that I lost money with the exchange rate and lost money with my bank. Which isn’t my fault. It’s there fault. It’s awful. And now Im having to pay for therapy because my mental health is so horrendous. I am NEVER EVER using this company again. They make me sick!!!!!!",1,0,en,Bookingstar1

On May 9, we booked a room in HOTEL 21 NYC, Queens, New York for two nights (21-23 May 2022), and the reservation was confirmed. I received an email from Booking.com on the 21st May morning at 7:33 indicating that I needed to update my credit card information since it was invalid. I re-entered my credit card information and received an email from Booking.com after an hour claiming that the payment had been denied and that I needed to change my card information. This time I decided to use a different card, and the next email from Booking.com stated that the reservation had been canceled due to a credit card verification failure, and this was before the allotted time of 7 hours to provide my card details that they mentioned in the first email. When I called the hotel (HOTEL 21 NYC) about the cancellation, they said it was done by Booking.com because they couldn't verify the card details and that they might help us re-book the hotel, but at nearly double the price I had paid before (I had paid 256$ and now they were charging 572$). I was furious and decided to phone Booking.com for help. After three attempts at calling customer service, I was finally able to speak with them. When I told them the complete scenario, they stated they couldn't help me since my bank (Bank of America) had refused to release the funds. They also said that after the initial email, I should have phoned my bank to request that the amount the property is billing be released, and that they couldn't do anything because the booking had been cancelled by the property. He said he couldn't do anything when I told him the reservation had been cancelled before the scheduled time and that I am on my way from Providence and would reach the hotel in another 1 hour and could pay directly using my card. Later, he stated he would call the property and confirm my booking at the same price I had paid before after I mentioned that the property manager said it had been cancelled by Booking.com.I was placed on hold, and after a little time, he informed me that the property manager had refused to give at that price, and that I would have to find another hotel. He offered me a list of hotels which he claimed were nearby to my existing hotel and of similar pricing. However, the list he showed me was for hotels that were far away from my current booking location. I couldn't look into any further information because I didn't have time, so I booked the first option, which was a Motel 11 miles from my previous reservation (close to Jamaica). I chose Hotel NYC 21 for its location because it was close to where I needed to go for official business. To my surprise, there was no problem this time when they charged my same credit card, and I didn't even have to contact the bank.This was the pinnacle of maltreatment. At the end of the day, both parties were clearly scheming to rob and harass visitors. When I was in Germany, I used Booking.com's services and was completely satisfied.

260,Sonya Ismail,unknown,2022-05-16T21:50:09.000Z,Absolutely discussing customer service…,"Absolutely discussing customer service from Booking.com. I booked a guest house in the Philippines for one night, my money was taken from Booking.com and when I turned up to the property, the property was under renovation, it had significant damage from the recent typhoon. I have a video and photo evidence of the property with the builders in there. I was told by the builders (who laughed at me when I said I have booked a night in there) that there is no way anyone can stay at the place and when they tried to call their boss, they could not get an answer. I then had to find another place to stay which cost me 5 times more. I message the property but have had no response. I called Booking.com and even they told me that they cannot get hold of anyone at the property. So, this is where the absolute joke of it all is.....  I had the phone hung up on me more than 5 times by Booking.com and only on one of the occasions did someone ring me back. I have emails stacking up and do you know what the end result is... Booking.com are telling me that I have to contact the property WHICH myself and Booking.com cannot get hold of. So basically, anyone can put a property up for rent or a room and just take your money and they actually don't exist. This scam is disgusting and the fact that Booking.com is letting it happen is a joke. Do you know Booking.com will not refund the money THEY took of me, for a property that you cannot stay in. If you google this property Dee Guesthouse White Sands and it says in black and white that they are Permanently CLOSED. I have asked for a manager and each time they tell me directly ""NO, you cannot speak to a manager"". And what is even worst, after writing this review, someone from their company should call me to help address this problem but I guarantee they will not. Now I`m going to a small claims court and will invest what ever time I have, for the sheer fact that this should not and will not happen to someone else. A big company like this should not be getting away with taking peoples money and not providing the goods. These are two of the many names of the call centre staff:Nour.

We requested the owner of the property to do a late check-in between 10PM-11PM on 28th April 2022. They accepted the request. I was travelling from Calgary with my pregnant wife and senior citizen mother. Upon reaching the property around 9PM and upon talking to the owner through buzzer code he said that “we won’t be able to accommodate you since we have flood in our apartment and we will issue you a full refund and have already informed booking.com AND can not help you right now”. I was out of my words because I was not informed of this earlier, only a message came when I was in flight (at 8:31 PM saying that we’re sorry). At that moment it was 7 degrees cold and I was stranded in a new city with my pregnant wife and senior citizen mother. I had to take care of them right away so booked a hotel (also through booking.com) and paid CAD1600 for the 3 nights. Upon reaching the hotel the first thing I did was to call booking.com. During my vacation of 3 days - I talked to 6 difference booking.com representative for total of 127 minutes after which their representative started disconnecting my calls. Booking.com representative kept taking owner's side and said the owner is denying all of this and he can not issue a refund and was always ready to accommodate you. The representative kept on repeating the same owners word and did not help us and said booking.com can not help you in this situation. I was SHOCKED!!!!!I am not that stupid that I will pay $1600 at new hotel when I already paid $1031 for a property for same duration of stay. I booked this property because I did not want to stay in a hotel and that apartment had a kitchen and a separate room for my mother, a balcony and a bigger space. I had to settle (without any of my fault) in an expensive hotel last minute in one small room without any view and no facilities. We work so hard during the weekdays to enjoy our weekend/vacations and this is what we get - a mental torture, a vacation ruined and loss of my hard earned income.

The return journey was even worse, the car was a beat up Jeep that looked like it had been in an accident, there was drink stains all over the back seats and doors and half the trim was missing from the interior. The driver had been smoking weed, we could smell it on him even through masks. He was weaving all over the road, the brakes didn't work properly and the final straw was him turning round to us and asking us to pay the toll through the Lincoln tunnel because he had no money.

I was left physically stranded after they cancelled my reservation 2 hours before I arrived in a city I had never been to before. As a young female solo traveler I was scared and anxious. I was told a booking.com team member would be in touch shortly to find suitable accommodation but no one contacted me. I waited in queue for half an hour and spoke to a customer service representative that found options 10 miles away from my original booking, and told me nothing was available closer because of the last minute nature. She assured me that whatever I ended up finding, booking.com would reimburse me for travel and hotel and sent me an invoice email.  I ended up having to stay in a travelodge on a motorway, 5 miles from my original destination and next to an abandanded petrol station and adult store, I felt extremely vulnerable. Taxis took over an hour to arrive as I was essentially in the middle of nowhere.When I arrived home I wrote a formal complaint and was contacted by a respresentative via phone who told me they would 'round up my £99 invoice to £100 and it would be paid within 7 business days'. That was 6 weeks ago. I have emailed Booking.com a total of 11 times and no-one has responded. I cannot describe the level of anxiety this company put me through, they are truly awful.

I did it but booking told me that it was too late because I told them to cancel my flight 20min earlier… I tried to explain that I decided to cancel because I was told that they was no other options, which was not true information.

The listing was not clearly indicating that. Then, even the room is not the same one as shown in the listing! It was tiny, with a double bed, big wardrobe and dressing table in a 5 sq m2 room. No space for me to move, or put luggage. I and my husband decided to leave and agreed with the landlord that he would refund me. So we left the place with trust to the landlord, and Booking customer service also ensured that they would refund me in this case. However, the landlord disappeared and ignored all my messages/calls asking him to accept free cancellation request. I had to book another place in Paris for the same period, 5 nights. Same time, I am paying to this SCAMMER on booking, waiting for a response. At 12:00 AM the last day, the landlord cancelled my reservation, saying I did not show up. I provided proof to Booking that I did show up, and told Booking this property is a SCAM.However, after hours of calling customer service and disputing on the line, Booking insists that they could not compensate me in this case, even though I reported this as a SCAM.

Booking offered us a solution for about the same price but a lot further from the city centre and with less comfort. They told us that we could always look for something else ourselves or get a refund. That last option was not an option since our flights could no longer be cancelled. They said that after our stay we had to inform them on the difference in price and that they would see what compensation they could offer. Because it was only three weeks before our stay, the options to choose from were very limited and prices were crazy. In the end we selected a place with less comfort (e.g. people having to sleep in the living room where in our previous booking everyone could sleep in a bedroom) but close to the city centre as that had our preference over the comfort. Instead of 500 euro the total was now 800 euro. After our stay I sent them the invoice and they said they could only offer us a refund of 40 euro because that was the price difference between our original stay and with what they had suggested. They did not mention in advance that this is how they calculate it. It is very disappointing how they have handled this. How it is possible for people to cancel your booking this close to the date without any further consequences for them by booking and how you as customer just need to accept that the stay you so much looked forward to gets overshadowed by stress.

A couple of months in advance I did a package deal through Booking, which included Flight, hotel, and car rental. This was for a 40th birthday vacation for my wife to Tampa.

As I give my name, nothing is found in the system, then try my confirmation #, nothing(What?) I said how is this possible? I showed all my information where I booked my trip and they said since Booking is a 3rd party, they never received any information from them. I was livid and in disbelief. At that moment we were without a hotel and basically got conned. My wife calls the agency to explain the situation, and they said our reservation was cancelled 😡 without even our knowledge. We could never understand the explanation, but they said due to an over allotment. We basically got bumped, and gave to someone else at a higher price. The least they could of done was alert me, before traveling all the way from Boston.  So we were able to get the refund without issue. However, thank God the hotel manager was there to sympathize in our situation. She worked with us to give us a good deal to match what booking was offering. Thank God we were still were able to get a room for the whole week and just for the 1st night stay in an accommodating room. It all worked out and our vacation was saved. Still shame on Booking!

I booked Pensacola Portofino unit 5-1002 from April 23 - April 30. When I received the conformation email from booking.com it showed only 6 nights, leaving me without lodging for Friday April 29. I am 100% certain I entered my dates correctly, as I had looked at many other locations prior to selecting Portofino. I immediately contacted booking.com via email 3 times (I've still not received a response) so I phoned customer service (after waiting 1 hour and 45 minutes on hold) and a very nice person indicated she could assist me. When she was unable to update my reservation she was puzzled and contacted a supervisor online. Her supervisor told her to let me know my reservation could not be changed or cancelled without forfeiting my $ 1745.00 down payment. How is this even possible?????

Booking.com advertises great customer service, but I experienced the absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced. The additional fees at Portofino added over $500 to my total price.

I had been given a voucher to rebook direct the hotel themselves to use when my trip was cancelled due to Coronavirus restrictions. Having received no reply from the hotel regarding my attempts to rebook I then contacted Booking.com and explained the whole issue to one of their advisors. Their reply was that the hotel was no longer on their site which is pretty much stating the absolute obvious! Given that the original payment was made to Booking.com and not the hotel direct and considering that the cancellation was due to the global pandemic I would have expected a bit more assistance and explanation from Booking.com. Most similar industries would only receive payment from Booking.com by invoice either on check in or check out. Thus as my trip was cancelled weeks before travel it is reasonable to suggest that Booking.com have retained my payment without offering any service, support, assistance, or explanation. Be very careful, you only need to see the huge numbers of terrible reviews they have received",1,1,en,Bookingstar1

404,Keri Sheehan,unknown,2022-05-02T01:07:26.000Z,The hotel they let us book via site was a homeless hostel and they told us they were not responsible to help us.,"This year I have booked over 5 hotels with booking.com. each one not living up to the description or facilities. I have decided its a post lockdown knock on effect. However due to the negative experiences to date I decided to triple check a stay in NYC in Sep 2022. Hold on to your seats because you will not believe this review...So I tried to look at the hotel on Google and saw that although I had booked it via Booking.com this year, it was showing on Google as ""temporarily closed"" so as a Genius member I accessed the priority chat help and was reassured the hotel is closed but will open up again in September. They had called management who confirmed all was OK.  I asked why it was closed and no answer was given. So, I took to Google and to my suprise I find a NYC news article explaining that the city had addressed the covid homeless crisis by using hotels as crisis shelters. The Radisson Wall St being one of them...our hotel and the sticking point... it was going to remain closed till at least 2023 and continue to function as a hostel?? So again back onto chat sharing screen grabs and explaining we were going for just 5 nights to a music event and arriving late at night so I was really concerned we were going to end up with no where to stay on arrival!! An hour later we had established I was correct, the hotel is closed no plans to reopen yet it was live on booking.com as we spoke. I was so shocked and asked well what would have happened if I had not discovered this now. The second call handler tells me on arrival in NYC if I had contacted them they would have relocated me. So I explain that I now needed to be relocated, prices had risen and they needed to cover it. She spoke to her manager and he confirmed the booking had been cancelled and they would compensate me $29 for my trouble!!!!! I was shocked I had literally alerted them to the fact they were hosting a homeless shelter as a hotel on their site and that I now had to rebook elsewhere at higher prices and $29 was their ""compensation"" So I finally had a hour call with the manager who went back and fourth and when I explained had I not done my research it would be costing them at least $1000 to rebook us in somewhere else if we had arrived to no hotel for our stay. He then tells me ...actually the previous call handler was incorrect. Its not in the new COVID T&C terms that we have to help you in this situation. As the hotel is not open due to covid related change of circumstance you would have not revieved any compensation or relocation support!! This was the manager. Eventually I was offered $180 credit and that took so much pushing from my side. I had to them spend 1hr rebooking elsewhere at double the cost due to price increases since I booked. They really do not care!! So in summary..They are listing a hotel that is closed as its now a homeless shelter and yet still accepting bookings on their site.They will then not offer any support if you turn up and have no where to stay. He even told me he believes the ""hotel"" homeless shelter plans to allocate some rooms in September back to visitors via the site even though it will still predominantly be a shelter! The first agent clearly lied telling me he spoke to management at the hotel and all was good.The second agent told me we would be compensated and found new accommodation at booking.coms cost and her manager said the opposite..

No problem I thought - the same company so should be able to transfer my booking from one of their hotels to another. I first contacted Booking.com to explain the situation. I then discovered that my booking was not with Booking.com but with Bedsonline, a 'partner', and only Bedsonline could change the booking. Booking.com said that they could do nothing to help and I could not cancel for free as I had done in the past with Booking.com bookings.I tried to contact the hotel I was booked in but the phone just rang and rang.I then contacted Amano Reservations, explained the situation and asked if they could help. No was the answer, they said the booking was with Hotelbeds and only Hotbeds could change it. Hotelsbeds apparently owns Bedsononline. and only deal with commercial companies in the travel business not individuals. Of course none of these organisations offer the opportunity to speak to real people, it is all conducted through email which they chose to ignore.I then went back to Booking.com where I am at 'Genius Level 2' which according to their website means I am entitled to '10%–15% discounts applied to the price before taxes and charges Free breakfast Free room upgrade' except in this case where they offer nothing just saying that they use partners to ensure completive pricing. I checked with both hotels and could book rooms for the same price that Booking.com and its 'partner' offered.I am 75, this was my first visit to Berlin and I, my wife, my son and daughter-in-law had to manage with all the toing and froing that this mistake caused.

And every time I want to change it, the person on call tells me it will take 24 to 48 hours. Which on it's own makes a lot of sense. However, after calling 2 times a week for a month to see where my flight changes are going. Today, Air France told me that Booking.com should have a direct ""BTT"" line to call them for such matters if emails are not answered fast enough. So I asked afterwards the person at booking to call them, I was a bit rude I must admit, but after a whole months of calling back and forward to change my return flight, it really starts to get to me.I asked them to call this ""BTT"" line but the person told me it's not possible and tells me again about the email and the 24h / 48h waiting time. I got mad about it since I Air France just told about it !!!I got very frustrated and said ""you guys should get your thumbs out your butt and stop sending these emails and actually call them. Because I know there are flights and that there is a direct phone line.""The person hangs up on me... I know I was rude. And I am sorry about that. It should not happen. But I don't understand why they can't make a call when I know they have such a line.I requested change of flight... that is all. Air France told me all the different flights I could have, but unfortunately they can't do anything because I had made my reservation with booking.comBecause of all this hassel, it is the very last time I am using booking.com. Customer service is the worst I have ever experienced.*Managed to get a person who decided to call the ""BTT"" Line as mentioned above, and get a reply within an hour saying that it is Saturday and there offices are closed...I call Air France to ask about the ""BTT Line"" again, and mentioning the complaint I have with booking, i ask if these offices are closed, the person chuckles and apologises and says that no, these offices are open every day. He apologises for booking's behavior and assures me that the day before my flight if nothing has changed, Air France will then be able to change my flight.

The booking.com rep gets back on the phone and says I need to pay the whole amount again making a double payment and the deposit as well to stay, and that if I send in my bank statements showing both payments they can see about giving me a possible refund on one of the payments within a week or two weeks. Terrible service on both ends the hotel and the service. They also have an issue with clarifying booking.com payments and Priceline payments even though they acknowledge they are partners there were more issues receiving my receipt of payment and confirmation # which again they couldn’t find in either of their systems. Wouldn’t recommend paying online vs simply paying in person without hassles at any other hotel.Would also like to add/edit that when we called booking.com and Priceline to have the hotel allow us the cancellation without charge due to the issues, the hotel said they need to charge us the full amount and would not excuse the issues or make any exceptions and charge us for the cancellation.

I called the hotel the night before my arrival date and they were super nice and understanding, they cancelled my reservations without penalty fees. And because I asked about it, they also assured me that booking should not charge me also because the hotel are the ones that do that and they were not. But. A very rude rep for booking customer service told me first that I will be charged the full amount plus and extra charge for the cancellation. When I questioned him on why would they be charging me when the hotel didn't, he placed me on hold to supposedly speak to a supervisor. He then comes back and tell me that the only way I can get the reservation cancelled in their system is with a special booking cancellation code from a booking.com prepaid card which I can only get from my local store in the exact amount of the stay. And he wanted to stay on the phone with me so I do not get the wrong card. I told him I didn't see where paying for the stay to have it cancelled made sense. He then tells me that after it was cancelled in the system they would refund the prepaid card back. Now red flags hit because why do that when they can just not charge my card, after all I pay for the stay at check in. So I told him I'd call him back and I called the hotel again. And was once again met by real customer service and was told that I was not charged and will not be charged by them and there should be no reason why booking should be charging me. I called booking back and was once again met with rude, nasty unprofessional reps. We got into it about them charging me when the hotel it's and it clearly states in booking terms and conditions the, 'If you cancel a booking or don't show up, any cancellation/no-show fee or refund will depend on the service provider's cancellation/no-show policy'. There exact wording on there site. I was told by this horrible rep that I should have booked with the hotel and hung and I will be charged then hung up on me. I tried calling back and they will just put the call on hold without saying anything and just leave me on hold.

Is our data that leaked? Where is one’s privacy??? I just had the worst experience with Booking I had a reservation(2892346831) at a certain price, got the confirmation email with that price only to receive a message saying there was a price error and I either have to pay more than 10x what I planned or cancel the reservation.I called the customer service, since I’m working in a tourism agency I know perfectly how this type of cases should be handled: the intermediate negotiates with the hotel who assumes the impact, never affecting the client. But that’s not apparently the case with Booking.I explained the case, even explained how it should be handled yet received no other solutions. When I said I accept neither canceling nor paying 10x more for an error that’s not even mine, they said ok then the reservation will be canceled. And that’s it.I really do doubt ever using Booking again although I have the highest “genius 3 level account” due to the various travels I did with them. Knowing how the behind the scenes go in these cases due to my job, this is the most unprofessional management I’ve seen so far.Since I’m working in the same industry, let me give you a piece of advice: when you have a price error whether it’s manual/technical/with channel manager, negotiate with the entity to split the impact never put it on the client’s end with a ridiculous discount on a price he didn’t even agree to pay.Honestly now that I’ve been through this, I appreciate how correct and transparent my company is, and I understand why we manage to keep our clients loyal just by giving them their rights not fooling around them as if they wouldn’t understand.",1,0,en,Bookingstar1

I contacted the hosts immediately (via message, phone call and text) with no response until I spoke to Booking.com who called the property over an hour later.The fridge would only come on when the microwave and hob switches were also on, suggesting a wiring issue. We were advised that somebody would come to look at the heating but no one came within 2 and a half hours of reporting it.Adding to this, the shower was blocked, the toilet was coming off the wall and propped up on wooden blocks, the vinyl was peeling off of all the cupboards / units and we witnessed a rat entering a skip which was conveniently placed directly outside the window of the property. At this stage, we were fed up of the inadequacy of the property and decided we would be better off at home. The property are refusing to refund our money and Booking.com are not helping due to the property being up to ‘proper standards.’ If this is proper standards, I’d hate to see what improper standards look like.

We were offered 2 alternate placebut these were further away from where we needed to be. We were told to cancel the booking. This caused us undue grief and stress at a time we were travellingto attend a funeral of a close relative. This caused additional stress to my 93 year old father who was with us so much that he was quiet and not eating or sleeping much during the stay.I feel we were fobbed off so the booking could be given to someone else. They waived the fees as the issue was their end - no electricity at the propoerty and this couldnot be rectified until next week. I feel no business would allow loss of custom for a week and would have been pressuring this issue to be fixed. I feel they had a longer booking lined up to replace us.We had to look for a property to stay. I went to book The Commissioners Quay Inn but when completing the booking process it errored stating there were no longer any rooms at the property. I found a hotel that, although expensive, was suitable in location for us to attend the funeral. This was a single room for 4 people inclusive of an old man, a woman and two men.This was uncomfortable and awkward for us all but was the only suitable place near where we needed to be - suitable in location and cost. The owners at this hotel were fantastic, we have no issues with them.I later found that the Commissioners Quay Inn had a booking for me costing £218. I cancelled but they will not waive the fee. The booking failed (it stated there were no rooms available when I attempted to complete the booking) and I was not sent any notification a booking had been made by either Booking.com or Commissioners Quay Inn.

After much pleading with the hotel, they were given a room for a single night for an extortionate price and were then left to find alternative accommodation. When I raised this with booking.com they requested proof that my parents had had to book another hotel. This seemed like a ridiculous request to me (what if they had stayed with friends?! I don't see what right they have to ask this in order to provide a refund) but I nevertheless provided their invoice as proof they'd booked elsewhere. This wasn't good enough, they wanted a bank statement to show they had paid for the alternative accommodation! Again ridiculous, but I provided this. Have we recieved a refund yet? No. After multiple emails back and forth they now say they are investigating the matter with the hotel, something they should have done in the first instance. Seeing the other reviews here I don't suspect we will be getting the £600+ back anytime soon.

Michael was not helpfull at all and was changing his story all the time, he was not familiar with my case (I have sent previously photos to booking.com with bugs, he was trying to tell me that I haven't ). He said that booking.com cannot do anything in regards to the refund until the property accepts cancellation.

520,customer,unknown,2022-04-19T17:17:43.365Z,DO NOT BOOK WITH BOOKING.COM PLEASE AVOID AND READ,"If I could rate this 0 I would. Please see the below dispute made to booking.com regarding a booking we made for London Excel Apartment. Firstly, on the day of our check in we were called 2 hours prior to our arrival asking for a £500 deposit that was not enclosed in any information or terms and conditions provided, so as you can imagine it was difficult to try and gather that amount last minute. Then as on our way to the apartment, we were called to be ‘told’ we had been swapped to a bigger apartment to accommodate our group of 8 and was this okay, meaning they had already done it, so we agreed assuming it would be the same standards as the one we had booked originally. We were also told that there was on-site security and that we needed to send photos of all of our ID’s which we found to be strange. Upon our arrival we had been given a code to get a key and fob from a security key box outside that didn’t work for 30 minutes and after numerous phone calls of trying to get through for support that we didn’t receive, we finally had managed to get in ourselves and were unfortunately horrified at what we walked in to. Holes in the walls, grease and dirt over the walls and tables, human head and body hairs under our sheets, clean washing in the washing machine and tumble drier showing no cleaning or new sheets had been applied, utensils for food layered in grease and dust, handles missing from cupboards and doors, the shower mat was still wet in the bathroom, which leads me to say that one of the opposite neighbours had informed us that 8 Chinese men had lived there in number 48 for three days and left the morning of our arrival, as I’m sure you would agree is disgusting seeming as the cleaning had clearly not been carried out afterwards. Furthermore, we had encountered a 30+ minute phone call with ‘the receptionist at London Apartments’ who was excessively rude, patronising and in no way accommodating or helpful, claiming at first he was in offices of london apartments then quickly changed his comment to ‘working from home’ so we were unable to go and resolve this in person. He gave us only one option of cancelling our reservation or forced to sleep in non-liveable conditions. When we asked for his name, occupation and information to talk to a manager the phone call suddenly went silent for a number of minutes before being cut off. Frustrating. After this, we had politely emailed them explaining we were extremely unhappy with the customer service and standards that we had been provided and would not physically be able to stay there, recording ourselves leave the key where needed and eventually leaving. We were informed our £500 damage deposit was secure during our chat to whomever taking our phone call and would be refunded when necessary. Since then we have been in contact with booking.con directly as well as our banks to request a charge back and to inform who ever it mconcerned of our traumatic experience. Just to add, we just so happened to know some friends that were in London for the same event who had booked the same apartments and entailed the exact same experience and requirements last minute, like the £500 damage deposit and last minute ‘swap’ of rooms but were unfortunately in a situation that meant they had no choice but to stay there. Any extra information you require to help us further can be provided like photo and video evidence with exact timings and dates. The specific assistance we’re hoping for is a full refund of £912 on our original booking with this property and full refund of the £500 deposit which was paid on our day of arrival. The property was not up to standard and looked nothing like the pictures they have provided on booking.com, in addition, upon entering the property it was clear that it had NOT been cleaned from the previous guests - we have taken photos to prove this. As a website that provides a service to the public I’m sure you’re already aware that this is false advertisement  and legally can be reported to the trading standards office as this is breaking marketing and advertising laws. The property did not make us feel safe and secure which is a basic necessity for a guest, as a group of a young girls this made us feel uneasy. Upon ringing to complain about the the property and how we had quite clearly been deceived by false marketing and advertisement the “manager” was very rude, extremely unreasonable and all around unhelpful and was more than happy to see a group of young girls 4 hours away from home stuck with no where to stay. Overall, this was a very distressing and upsetting experience.AVOID USING BOOKING.COM AND DO NOT BOOK LONDON EXCEL APARTMENTS. THEY ARE SCAMMERS AND A FRAUD.",1,0,en,Bookingstar1

Negative review for booking.com because my case is crystal clear the company wasn't honesty, ignore all my contacts leaving me without solutions, a lot of bed reviews with similar problems on internet and they take the property side, on the thousands phone call to them people just say ""When the property do not want refund a costumer we can't do nothing""So you book with them, pay by their website but when need fix the problem they get out of the situation... Very convenient. The worse platform you can use for book.Booked one apartment in Preston for 5 Nights, Reservation number (2208.805.875) arrived everything looks ok, apartment not bad, nothing special, a little dark and closed ( No window in the Kitchen, Bathroom and corridor.) but still not bad, until my arrive they answer very fast, kind and helpful. Just arrived I realize that my mobile phone dosnt work and it's absolutly necessary for my job... Very kind I sent message to them asking if they know which operator works in that house and the answer was ""You can use wifi."" But big companys do not speak with their costumer by whatsapp, for example booking.com do not have a whatsapp number to speak with them, you need phone signal, same for the company I work... I in very kind way trying to fix the problem, I bought 2 new sim cards of 2 different operators. No signal at all even next to the window, so I sent a new message to them with picture of sim cards and the screen of my phone with 0 Signal, asking if they can change for another apartment (I saw they had one in the same building) or charge me for 1 night and refund my other nights, they answerd ""We will speak with our team and contact you soon,""after 3 hours nobody contact me, I need my number with signal for my work, stay hours without mobile phone signal gave me anxiety, Without any answer I decide contact Booking, they were unsuccessful in talking to the people in charge.. Then I explain everything to booking.com let they know that I was putting the keys on the their letter box and leave, days past and they never answer about my last message. After one week and with a lot of contact with Booking.com, they refuse charge me for 1 night and  me my refund, even having only stayed a few hours, crystal clear that the problem was in their property, they do not fixed the probelm with me, actually don't even answered, and booking.com has been in their side. They are the kind of people that don't care about be honesty, about service to the costumer or fix problems, they want take your money and don't even answer you for fix problem of their apartment.

I have used Booking.com many times before with no problems but on this occasion their treatment of me has been a disgrace.  I booked a room at the Atrium Hotel near Heathrow airport for one night on 7th May prior to an early morning flight on 8th May.  All was confirmed but then on 6th April I received an e-mail advising me that my credit card required updating.  This I did and received an email in return confirming the update.  Exactly the same email arrived five days later on 11th April so again I updated my credit card details and received an email confirmation.  Then on 12th April I received an email advising me that my booking was cancelled due to an invalid credit card.  I rang the hotel who would not reinstate the booking and advised me to speak to Booking.com which I did.  They advised me that the hotel was now full and my booking could not be reinstated.  They could offer no explanation regarding my 'invalid credit card' which is a platinum amex card and I use it nearly every day without a problem.

We have so far spent over 11 hours now being tossed between booking.com and airlines because of a covid impacted cancellation by one of the airlines meaning we couldn't fly to our destination. We now only have return tickets and are trying to move them and book the tickets there... I had one service representative accidentally drop the phone and hang up the call, another transferred me to a dead end line. I've talked to several other representatives that were friendly enough, but seemingly without any ability to help. To compound the issue, we booked this over the phone and they put my middle name down as my first name only, and so the airline is telling me there are issues that only booking.com can resolve... I understand that changes make things difficult and that this is a tough time for all airlines/travel agents, but no one at booking.com seems to have the authority or willingness to try to help, they all just point to someone else resulting in literal hours of waiting to talk to another representative. I'd say they make the booking process easy, but if you need to make a change even if a covid impacted cancellation (which is common these days unfortunately...) through no fault of your own, then you are going to spend a ridiculous amount of time on the phone and get nowhere. I am still waiting to resolve this and my next step is to simply dispute the charge with my credit card company who have advised me that that's probably the easiest path....",1,0,en,Bookingstar1

The pictures showed a well appointed place with a clean homely look and ""good 7.5 "" reviews ....not a Palace but nice place. We paid up front as Booking.com require. However when we arrived we found a very different story. We were handed a key by the ""cleaner"" who spoke no English and also wore no face mask. The place was filthy, literally grime in both kitchen and bathroom sinks, parts of the shower were missing/broken. Toilet had definitely, definitely not been cleaned in some time!!! Electric sockets were hanging out of the walls and the light fittings were hanging loosely from broken fittings from the ceilings. The beds were filthy with curly hairs in and grimey pillows that stank!!!! The front door had a gap of 10mm on the shut side with parts of the door piled up behind it inside the apartment.  We phoned Booking.com and ""Edmar"" assured us he would help us get our money back and launch a complaint along with a suitable equivalent apartment for us....after phoning back eventually my wife had a message from the owner who "" couldn't understand, and did not agree"" he was passive aggressive and after messaging my wife several times I complained to Booking.com who did.....nothing! I then messaged the owner asking for a full refund and explained why we were asking for it.....no reply!! I spent a total of 5 hours trying to deal with Booking.com on an island a very long way from home,and Booking.com did nothing to help us. We were accused by their staff of exaggeration or not telling the truth despite reviews since we booked this property now bearing out the truth of our complaint.

I booked an apartment with a kitchen, 4 months in advance for a friend 50th bday surprise who was flying in from out of state! I had a question about the kitchen utensils. I tried contacting the unit owner by phone but phone number was a non working number. I contacted booking.com  customer service and was told that they will get back to me in a week. No one contacted me so I called and I was told that they were unable to reach the unit owner and they will seek help of a supervisor and get back to me. Once again I called back and was reassured that all was okay bc this unit is booked for weeks and no complaints listed. I soon found out that the unit was in a gated community yet no apartment or contact person was given to me with my booking. I reached out to booking.com again and was told that I had to wait until my booking date and time and if upon my arrival,  I should have issues, call them and I will be provided with similar accommodations within 30 mins!!!! 3 times on 3 different occasions I was told this in the 4 month period . What an embarrassing, frustrating and expensive nightmare this turned out to be to me and my friends whom I had picked up at the airport. 😖😣Needless to say we Did Not Get In and I couldn’t get any agent to speak to for almost 40 mins. All we got was the ring around auto message of pressing buttons that took us nowhere !!! We all tried calling! Twice I was hung up on without speaking to someone. Each person thereafter passed u on to another and another. I kept explaining that they should read the notes left by previous agents but they all took the easy way out and passed u on to someone else. We repeatedly asked for a supervisor but was told not one was available in the 4 hours of dealing with these incompetent agents with a language barrier of I could only say from India.

What is the purpose of booking 4 months in advance to get a deal and now having to pay through your A—— for a similar place with present price?? Half a star to the last agent! He said he had daughters and won’t want them stranded at night.

I was told to call the airlines to change the date, but the airline stated my only option was to cancel the booking all together and rebook for the correct dates. I called booking.com to let them know the airline couldn’t change my dates unless I cancelled everything and started over. I was told no, you will be reimbursed because you have a flexible ticket. Booking.com was not able to modify my dates themselves, which makes no sense if they offer flexible ticket options but can’t do anything to modify them. I was told to look online and see what the cost of the ticket for the date I wanted is, while I was still on the line with the booking.com employee. Why I had to look up ticket pricing for them, I have no idea. I gave them the price from the airline’s website, and was told that I would be refunded the price of my return flight so it would balance out. I was told to go ahead and purchase the new plane tickets with my new return date, and then I’d get a refund. I asked the employee where do I buy the ticket? Through the airline or through booking.com again, and he responded it didn’t matter where I book the ticket, I’ll get my refund. So I booked through the booking.com app again since I was told it didn’t matter, and it was cheaper than the airline website. A week later I still have no refund, so I call to check the status. I am then told they have a policy that any changes to the reservations have to be done through the airline to get a refund. I asked them why did their colleague tell me it didn’t matter where the ticket is purchased, if they have a policy about it?! That’s exactly why I asked where to buy the ticket, so there wouldn’t be any problems. I called booking.com 3 times, and was on the line for 45 minutes so they could help me figure out how to change the date on my flexible airplane tickets, just to be told wrong information. Unbelievable!! Now, my case has been sent up through their department to be reviewed and I will be contacted in 24 hours to let me know if I’ll get my refund or not. Absolutely ridiculous!!! I shouldn’t be penalized because their colleague told me incorrect information. What’s the point of paying extra for flexible tickets if they can’t even help with any changes?

565,Justin James,unknown,2022-04-13T04:40:53.000Z,Horrendously costly and stressful,"- Booked accommodation through Booking.com 5 months in advance for a stay in Melbourne over F1 weekend- 2 weeks in advance the property was reconfirmed via email and paid for ($1,280)- A few days later I tried to organise (ahead of time) a check-in / key collection point (as I had read reviews that this was an issue with this property) FYI- MELBOURNE SOUTHBANK BEAUTY SPOT is the property in question- 2 days later I received a text from the property saying that the booking will be cancelled - no reason given- I then contacted the property who (after some time) said that the current guest contracted covid and they had no option but to allow them to stay (this is now 7 days prior to check in date)- I informed the property that covid rules in VIC say to quarantine 7 days, upon 7th day can leave without the need for testing and added that we would be happy to check in one day later to allow them to clean the room, to which they responded ""we have already advised we can't accommodate you for the 5 days of your stay""- Booking.com gave written confirmation that they would help to relocate us and it would be at the expense of the property- They provided 2x alternate (like-for-like) options and asked us to select one... when I went to secure I noticed they were dates for the month following, NOT for our original stay- I was then told by booking.com that this is ""absolutely not possible because it is a computer system and mistakes are not possible"", to which I told them to check the link that they sent me to see for themselves. The response was ""We don't have to because we know that is not true""- Went back to another booking.com agent who apologised and offered a larger property but in a different town altogether (one hour drive away), to which I pointed out was unsuitable- Booking.com then instructed us to arrange alternate accommodation and send through the invoice and apply for reimbursement, however being such late notice (and on F1 weekend), the only other options were in excess of $8k (6x times what we originally paid!)- Asked booking.com for confirmation that the additional cost would be covered to which they said ""you must pay first and then your application for reimbursement would be assessed""- Asked numerous times to speak with a supervisor or team leader and was declined every time- Demanded to speak with a manager and was offered a call back. After one hour the phone rang for a couple of seconds and I wasn't able to answer in time - tried to call them back but before I could even dial I received an email saying that the payment had been refunded and a ""compensation"" had been given ""for any inconvenience""- Checked the email and conpensation amount - $120, which is obviously well short of the additional $7k for alternate accommodation- Went back to booking.com and they advised that because I had ""accepted"" the compensartion, they were not obliged to assist any further and left me out to dry- Requested again to speak with management - again declined- Asked for the email address to send through a request for reimbursement and was given a bogus address- Asked for email address to write a formal complaint and they told me that I basically have no grounds for complaint and that I need to be patient for the refund to be issuedALL of this is documented in webchat, text messages and screenshots, including booking.com subsequently telling me that what I was initially told was incorrect and they should never have offered to help in the first place!",1,0,en,Bookingstar1

I have been calling Booking.com phone support (located in Singapore) for weeks now, and they very politely find numerous was to fail to refund my money.Summary- Booking.com actively delays refunding so they can benefit from the float. Frustrating customer service process (not the agents- the consciously programmed APP and their consciously slow internal financial policies) string out refunds.

When I arrived I was told the booking has been cancelled. I now had 4 of us with no accommodation. The hotel tried to get us onto one of those group hotels so we waited for 2 hours trying to get rebooked. In this time a lady came to reception saying her card didn’t work. It turns put her hotel booking with  this hotel group had been overbooked and they had moved her to the hotel I was booked  into and that she had been given the room a few hours before. I eventually found in my own time and frustration a hotel  Best Western, which was free for the time I needed. At further expense I got a taxi to this hotel and paid over a €100 more to stay on this hotel.  All in all a very stressful and frustrating experience which lost us the whole day/evening of our trip.

We assumed that it is for the verification purpose and they want to do it to block the reservation but we got message from Booking.com that the payment was not processed as card details were not correct.

First of all, for pay at property the card details are taken only for the purpose of blocking the reservation and actual amount is to be payed at hotel (we can pay with cash or even any other card). On trying to reach their customer support they told us to contact the property without extending any help. Now why am I booking through your portal if I have to contact and resolve these issues with the property?Either it was some fraud attempt from their end or they got probably they just wanted to cancel the booking now and charge us more on re-booking (because if we book just a week before then prices will obviously be high).Really bad service.

Unfortunately I am disappointed with Booking.com through which we made the booking!  The reason is as follows:We booked in Dubai the hotel Millenium Place for 2 adults and 3 children through Booking.com, knowing also that our 14 and 12 year old children count as adults in UAE and our 10 year old daughter as a child. So we booked 2 rooms, one for 3 people and one for 2 people! All good until we arrived at the hotel, there were only 4 beds in the rooms. When I asked at the reception for another bed, we should pay 600 AED in addition to the booking for the child. We booked and paid for 5 people at Booking.com and then had to pay on top of that! This is in my eyes a rip-off of Booking.com and would like to complain to Booking.com. The hotel (especially Mr. Hamza) was very nice, professional and accommodated me by instead of the 600 AED only 400 AED to pay and gave us then also for the children a suite, because in this room was more space for another bed. Unfortunately, the bitter aftertaste remains that I was ripped off here by BOOKING.COM and I unfortunately had to pay on it. Too bad, I believed that Booking.com is correct!

And try to get a review removed, even when you can prove it's false and made up, is impossible. B.CON also have the trick of burying bad reviews on some really disgusting places, so people still book through them, all these disgusting hotels I wouldn't let my dog stay in.We, as in my hotel, are getting close to the point, where we will no longer need B.CON (thank God) as a way for people to get to notice us, and as soon as that day comes, it will be, goodbye and good riddance.I could continue, but I'd end up writing a book that would make as much sense about B.CON as your electricity bill.",1,0,en,Bookingstar1

However last night I received an email confirming a booking for a holiday in Poland.  This was somewhat of a surprise as I never made any such booking.  I checked the email address of the sender in case it was a scam and it was from Booking.com.  However just in case the senders email address had been spoofed I logged in to my Booking.com account separately (not using any links etc).To my astonishment there was indeed a booking for 2 adults for 5 nights in KoloBrzeg.  I then received an email from Apartameny Proeko Polonia (via Booking.com) confirming the booking but the guest name was not mine.  At this point I tried to find a phone number to contact Booking.com on but as others have stated this just ends up in the customer going around in a circle on their website.I do not know if this was a scam or if someone else had made a genuine booking and Booking.com’s system had mistakenly allocated it to an account different to the person creating the booking.  However I have cancelled the booking and taken screenshots of the cancellation.  I have retained all emails including confirmation of the cancellation from Booking.com and Apartameny Proeko Polonia in case they are required if there is any dispute about this in the future.Luckily I did not have any credit/debit card details stored on Booking.com’s website.  I have never had any reason to contact Booking.com in all the years I have used them but I was shocked at how difficult they make for customers to speak to/or email them directly.I was surprised when I came to Trustpilot to check if others had had a similar experience to see how far Booking.com’s ratings have fallen.  They seem no longer to be the company they once were and I have deleted my account with them.

This card was not presented to cashier indicating it was done by booking.com On a budget holiday this impacted on our ability to get accommodation and slept 3 nights in a car Booking dot com chat with hotel is pointless as they do not open messages and customer service live chat was like pulling teeth and clearly they do not read what has already been stated.

Firstly why has booking.com not taken this down or done any proper checks on the place to be putting up on their website to sell. We spent add least 5 hours on the phone trying to arrange another place to stay with booking.com which we kept on getting hung up on. They recommended a place which we tried to book 3 times and still didn't work. One payment went through twice but no confirmation which we had to sort this out as well. Also the reviews on the place were that someone mentioned there were rats in the property not sure why booking.com recommended this place. They pretty much left us in London with no where to stay. In the end we had to book a hostel for my birthday since we were running out of time otherwise we would of missed our gig whihc we only just made.

I contacted Booking, the Hostel, PayPal and my bank about the transaction and this whole thing ended up into a complete mess – my reservation was cancelled, non-refundable and I was accused of ""fraudulent activity""! Important thing to note is that, I found this out only after 4 calls to Booking's customer support – none of the first 3 agents could clearly explain me what happened and none of them have sent me any e-mail or confirmation that my booking was cancelled in the first place, I only received a notification in the Booking App. 3 out of 4 agents didn't even speak fluent English so it was hard to understand what they were trying to say and one of them, named Alex simply hung up while talking to me.All in all, I now have to wait for up to 50 days to receive a chargeback from my bank, my reservation for 6 people in Barcelona is cancelled and Booking doesn't seem to care at all.",1,0,en,Bookingstar1

781,Dan Haxby,unknown,2022-03-21T10:07:05.000Z,Property cancelled last minute,"There is a weakness in the booking process.  I booked an apartment in the centre of Paris, many months ago, for what turned out to be a major rugby weekend.  We had the street address but the flat number was only going to be provided on the day or arrival along with an entry PIN code.  At around 5am on the Friday morning, I received an email from the property to tell me my credit card details were incorrect and that if I did not update them within 6 hours, my booking would be cancelled.  It seemed odd, but I updated them anyway and received an email saying that the update was successful.  then around 3pm I received another email telling me that my booking had been cancelled because my card details were incorrect.  I called the property, who told me that the booking had been cancelled, they could not tell me by whom, that I needed to rebook for another time (clearly not a sensible response) and to speak to Booking.com.  I suggested that the property would be free, that I had my card and was ready to pay, but they showed no interest in a solution.  I called Booking.com and spoke to someone who struggled to understand the situation and said I should speak to the property - I told them that I had and that they had pointed me to Booking.com.  After insisting that Booking.com helped me to find a resolution the Customer Services rep agreed to call the property and to call me back.  Half an hour later I got an email from someone else in Customer Services saying they had not been able to call the property - which was odd, as I had managed to do so.  It is clear to me that the property chose to cancel my booking - they are able to do so because the Ts and Cs state that effecting payment correctly is my obligation and so it is easy for them to hide behind the excuse that the details are incorrect even if not (I even had to upload a picture of my credit card a few weeks ago which feels like bad practice) - and to sell those nights to a higher paying customer for the rugby weekend.I had to find 2 nights accommodation at last minute for 4 people and to pay significant transport costs to continue our weekend as planned.  I will be looking to recover those costs from Booking.com.I recommend that (1) the property provider is removed immediately from your platform (2) all properties are required to provide FULL address details at the time of booking (3) there is a reverse cancellation charge imposed on properties who cancel, just as there is for customers (4) payment details are confirmed (by both sides) well in advance (5) my excess costs are reimbursed by Booking.com who can pursue the property for those costs.",1,0,en,Bookingstar1

The customer service is shockingly poor regardless of whether or not you are a loyal customer. If you need to book via booking.com please be vigilant when making payment and utilise the pay later options if available as they will take your money without providing the service!I completed a booking at ‘Foundry Luxury Apartments’ in Luton, a month in advance of the date I intended to stay and received no communication from the host or booking.com advising that there were any issues. I travelled to my destination on a day where there was heavy traffic and issues on the motorway so I made sure to contact the host when I was at least 30 mins away but received no response. Upon arrival, I called the number for the property provided on the booking.com app to make a query about gaining access and was referred to the manager. I attempted to call the manager 3 times with no luck but immediately after the 3rd attempt I received a text stating that there is a plumbing issue and that I would need to cancel my stay. This was evidently a lie as I was parked outside the building and could see a number of people entering and exiting so there were clearly people staying there. I reported this to booking.com and they advised me to give the host 30mins to provide me alternative accommodation, however this did not happen and the host was very rude and unprofessional telling me that there is over 100 properties in Luton on Booking.com and I should look. I went back to Booking.com and advised that I needed somewhere to stay that night and as I had already made full payment, requested for this amount to be transferred to another reservation or in the form of credit to enable me to book elsewhere without further inconvenience. However, they advised that they are unable to fulfil this request and that I must pay for alternative accommodation and request a refund of the difference up to £60 once I have completed my stay although they are fully aware that there would be a surge in prices due to the short notice. After almost 2 hours of going back and forth, the customer advisor disclosed that the host stated that there were supposed damages when I had stayed previously. This is most certainly not the case as I always take precaution wherever I stay and take images of all damages upon arrival as these hosts cannot be trusted! If this was also true then my booking would not have been confirmed when it was booked a month prior.After waiting for hours, I was not able to find an alternative and made my way back home.

She did some research & found that Booking.com uses THEIR OWN CREDIT CARD to make your reservations!!!!!!! So in this case, my refund went to them. The hotel clerk advised me to call Booking.com directly to advise them that I received a refund & want my money!! I called Booking.com & was actually told by the Booking.com em0loyee, that they DO NOT MONITOR anything for refunds & proactively return them to you!!!! If you don't make the call, you won't receive your money. In my case, I made the call & was assured my refund would be sent to me, not surprisingly, it wasn't!!!! Fortunately, I followed up to see if I received the credit!! I called Booking.com again & was told they were waiting on a call back from the hotel confirming that they issued this refund. I advised that I have a printed receipt from the hotel showing that the money went back to a Booking.com credit card ending in3723 on 2/19, so you've had my money for 28 days now, so why do you need their permission to give it to me? It certainly wasn't meant for you to have! He tried repeatedly blaming the hotel, but they did their part by telling me that I needed to call Booking.com directly to ask for my refund!!! He then checked with their internal credit card department to confirm they received the refund. They had. Then he had to email the Finance department to ask them to issue my refund!! WHAT A LOAD OF CRAP!!!! I told him that I can't imagine how much money they've made off of people who didn't catch this & they got to keep the money!!

When i booked, it was mentioned in the cancellation options that it is non refundable and i can change my dates of stay only one time.

I then contacted booking to change my dates of stay then they told me nothing about the terms were mentioned in my reservations. So i screenshot my reservations page and send to them, only then they tried to help me by contacting the hotel on behalf of me. While waiting for that, the hotel replied to me through booking chat that i can request for the change at the website, which was not possible because booking's system itself prohibit me to do so. so i contacted booking multiple times until they told me that the hotel did not allow me so. I did try to call the hotel myself, but it never get through, always no one's available to answer my call. So believing that lie, i booked the new dates directly at the website which is suprisingly much cheaper, and has free cancellation until may. When i checked in the hotel, i asked them why i cannot change my dates online, they said it's booking's problem. it's a 5 star hotel, so i don't think they're lying. so i'll never book with booking.com again cause it's a scam.",1,3,en,Bookingstar1

Booking.com add in the security deposit as income, which we have to collect and manage and goes nowhere near Booking.com and is returned to the guest.

925,Mrs Edmunds,unknown,2022-03-02T18:09:32.000Z,Booking in Skiathos last year,In spring last year my daughter booked an apartment for us in Skiathos town for July 25 2021 called Rania Studios.   It was advertised as free cancellation however the apartment owners  asked for a deposit of approximately 430.00 pounds which they assured us that it would be returned if we had to cancel  around the end of June we emailed them to cancel as the airline cancelled as my daughter and her friend had not had the opportunity to have a second dose of the vaccine.  We emailed the apartment  and asked it we could have our money back and they offered vouchers and the opportunity to rebook for this year .   unfortunately this wasn’t an option so we asked them to return the money and then heard nothing from them .   I have called booking.com advisers numerous over the last 8 months  and have gone through the whole story each time and even sent proof of bank transfer each time they have said that they would get back to us and if the apartments refused to pay up we would be reimbursed by Booking .com  each time we have heard nothing back.

Beds were made up nicely with swans made out of towels, were clean, the bathrooms looked basic but ok. Looked a great place to stay and experience Tulum. The  reality was another story. The rooms smelt like a mushroom cultivation farm with black mould on the pillows, blinds, walls and shelving. The floor had no tiles. It was dusty concrete. Anything that touched it became covered in dirt. O hot water in the showers either so couldn't even wash the dirt off!The room was filthy. I could write my name in the dust. My lungs could not cope with the black mould so we had to leave. The place was a health hazard and certainly not what we had been sold. I tried to get a refund from Booking.com but they really don't care. They offered me an insulting amount back which I refuse to accept so will be pursuing other avenues to recover my money.

929,Lisa,unknown,2022-03-02T11:06:26.000Z,Booking.com has 0 integrity false advertising of hotels,"Booking.com allows fraud and deception to occur by allowing hotels to falsely advertise their hotels on booking.com. Then when you arrive and have been completely mis sold the hotel booking.com refuses to reimburse you. My partner booked a hotel for part of our holiday in Mexico. The hotel transpired to be a health hazard as the rooms smelt strongly of mould. Even the pillow on my bed was mouldy (I will include pictures in due course). The rooms had concrete floors which were dusty and you could not shower in privacy as a mesh window in the bathroom revealed your nudity to the other hotel guests. There was also no hot water in the bathroom to actually shower with. Once at the hotel and realising that we were not getting what we paid for, we read some horrendous google reviews which explained we were never getting our money refunded from the staff at the hotel who always advise unhappy customers that they need to contact their agent. I explained to the staff that we knew they were going to say that to us and that if we went to booking.com, they would advise us to get a refund from the hotel. Both booking.com and the owners of this establishment have 0 integrity and are using each other to get away with scamming some of their customers. Booking.com should take responsibility for ensuring that the hotels are accurately represented on their website. I would not use booking.com or if you do only book a place for a single night. We had to lose 4 nights of money when we were treating to 15 year old children to a holiday after the difficulties of the past two years. We then had to use valuable time up from our holiday to go and find alternative accommodation. All boolking.com offered us was a good will gesture of $56.

930,Tommy Thro,unknown,2022-03-02T00:40:51.000Z,How BOOKING.COM SCAMS YOU WHEN YOU BOOK FOR FRIEND,"I just used for a friend who needed hotel room in Dubai and was emergency situation where low on $$.  I would guess if you are the person who is booking the hotel and going to pay for it, booking.com is okay...but if you are booking the room for a friend and it's not you...it's nothing but a SCAM SCAM SCAM.  When you reserve the room and you give the persons name and email address you are booking and giving your card number and paying for it and usually your card company will contact you and approve the transaction because you believe you are paying for the room...BUT NO YOU ARE NOT PAYING FOR THE ROOM... THE PERSON NEEDS THE ACTUAL CREDIT CARD  YOU USED TO BOOK THE ROOM TO BE ON THEM AT THE HOTEL..   So when my friend went into the hotel to sleep..and she expected it to be paid in full, they said no..YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE CREDIT CARD THAT WAS USED ON BOOKING.COM.   And who is going to have the credit card when a Friend in USA did the booking?  I'm sure when you are doing the booking somewhere there is small print notifying you that THE PERSON CHECKING INTO THE ROOM NEEDS THE CREDIT CARD USED ON BOOKING.COM.  When they don't produce the card..the hotel Jacks up the price  30% or whatever..so this IS A TOTAL SCAM.  TOTAL STRESS FOR THE PERSON AT THE HOTEL..TOTAL RAPE JOB OF HIGHER $$$.  What they also did was do a double booking .. I only did the booking 1 time but the guy at the hotel said there was a double booking for the same person..2 room..  THEY ARE A TOTAL JOKE.  So I called booking.com and they wanted me to download an app to my phone to cancel the booking.  I asked cannot you just cancel the booking?  You have my name and phone number i used to book and i'm calling from the same phone...but NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO You must down load the app.??? I'm thinking of last one who told me to down load to my computer and it went dead...and I get a call for ransom to fix it...  THESE PEOPLE ARE EVIL SCAMMERS AND THEY KNOW THEY ARE SCAMMERS...DO NOT USE... EXCEPT IF IT'S YOU WHO IS SHOWING UP TO USE THE ROOM..AND YOU HAVE THE CARD YOU USED FOR THE BOOKING..THEN I AM NOT SURE IF PROBLEMS.  BUT IF YOU ARE BOOKING FOR ANOTHER.. YOU ARE THROWING AWAY $$ AND GETTING SCAMMED...CANCELY YHOUR CARD AND CALL AND REPORT THE SCAM.  The worse this is you are using this service to help a friend out who is stuck in another country or state and you believe you are paying for the hotel when you hit the reserve and they have all your credit card info...but when the desperate person walks into the hotel..they tell her..OH YOU MUST HAVE THE CREDIT CARD USED FOR THE TRANSACTION OR THERE IS NO BOOKING..

We landed a bit later than expected (what tbh, happens all the time in Mexico) and they used this excuse to refuse our documents & not to give us a car. Despite the fact that we HAD ALREADY PAID the service, i could prove that I am a mexican resident, we had our driver licence... everything!We knew later that they do this to auction your car. They literally auction the car to whoevers gets in there first, no matter if you had already paid the booking.When we contacted booking.com to ask for a compensation or at least, an excuse, they just emailed back saying ""you were late so there's nothing we can do"".So disappointing.

Their customer service is absolutely terrible and did not understand my issue. I made a complaint about a booking I had with Westlake Los Angeles 30 Day rentals as the way they have treated us is unlike anything I have come across previously when using booking.com.Our first evening with them was unavailable on their side due to “cleaning company” issues.The company made no assistance to help find us alternative arrangements and left us out on our own.This issue was not communicated with any advance warning and was not even formally communicated on the booking.com app so we had correspondence instead it was all via a friend that we have based in LA.This was quite an issue for us when we were coming off a 12hr flight with no place to stay which resulted in us having to book $60 temporary accommodation for the evening.We were then stuck in limbo waiting for them again with no official correspondence on booking.com.We chased the phone number they had and they informed us they would cancel the whole booking which we then took a screenshot off and informed booking.com message service.The booking.com message service advised that we make the cancellation on our side (which we refused as it would make us liable).Hence the booking got fully cancelled and I believe we will get a full refund.However, we were then forced to book accommodation elsewhere to cover our trip at very short notice hence we spent more money than envisaged as we didn’t book in advance.In summary, the way we have been treated, with same day unavailability, limited correspondence and limited assistance is not aligned with the quality I have come to expect from booking.com providers and would like to request in app credit from booking.com (for future bookings) to help cover the expenses that we incurred with our unacceptable experience here on our LA trip (which for us is a once in a life time trip which had started so badly thanks to Westlake 30 Day rentals).",1,1,en,Bookingstar1

I forgave and forgot the last 2 incidents that booking.com is worse or better call non-existent in customer service. This time the proof is so obvious that the company must be sued for supporting and promoting stealing and cheating their clients. - we booked a jr. Suite for 3 nights and paid with breakfast in advance but we got a room with half underground looking and you felt like you are in abasement. When we complain we got a standard room at a price of a Jr Suite.- We wanted to reduce the stay and requested to reduce for 1 night as the room they gave us is not the one in the description and our request was rejected. -booking .com doesn't have as usual any customer service. There is no way to complain this unjust- We left the hotel after one night and we were charged full amount for 3 nights including breakfast. -Booking com says it was not booking it was the hotel. Hotel says it was booking com who rejected the request.so anybody who dont want to feel helpless and money stolen from you for services they dont deliver from your credit card, be aware. I myself finally made up my mind to stay away from fake best booking platform. My review on the hotel for the 3rd time (as i mentioned in 2 previous incidents) also on this scam hotel is not visible in booking.com because they are so customer focused (i guess their customers are the hotels who pay them commissions from those scammed money showing one Jr Suite room for many customers and giving a cheaper room or charging for breakfast that didn't consume or charging for nights that didn't happen because they reject change even if they sold the wrong products).",1,1,en,Bookingstar1

When contacted by booking. Com they informed us that they would try to find somewhere else but we would have to pay first then be refunded the difference. After over 2hrs conversation no place could be found that was available that night and getting through to a supervisor was extremely hard. Finally thr supervisor said they would have the customer service continue to find us somewhere. The result was they still didn't find anywhere and we ended up sleeping in the car. This was 2 adults and 3 children. At 1.30 in the morning they send us a place to see if it was available it wasn't till the next day. We managed to find somewhere the for the next 2 night but had to sleep in 3 separate rooms.

We couldn't check into the hotel till 2 so had to but convenience food to eat. When we checked in the menu was expensive to feed 5 and we had already had to borrow money to pay the hotel, so we had to buy more convienience food to eat that night and for the next day. We were told via communication with booking .com that they would look into refunding us this extra money and will look into compensation for our inconvenience. After returning home and sending the receipts we heard nothing back from them even after emailing them, so we contacted them.

Booking.com said that you pay 50% in advance but once you go to the hostel they ask you to pay the booking in full…4.	After all this, I asked them to give me money back.

After speaking to customer service, they say it was ""only"" a pre-authorization charge and I'll get the money released back to me within 5 days.

Unable to get home I made the above reservation. I paid in full prior to checking in. On checking in the staff asked for a pre-authorisation of £25. It's very rare a hotel asks me for a pre-authorisation if I've pre-paid. On the occasions they do, this is only in case of any extras. In the past I have always explained I won't be charging to my room and if I do I'll pay cash. This has been entirely satisfactory for every hotel I've ever stayed in, until last night.Drakes hotel refused to allow me to stay without this pre-authorisation. No-where in the booking process did you explain that Drakes will only accept a stay with a pre-authorisation. If you had specified this, I would not have chosen Drakes. Having paid for the room prior to check-in, I didn't have £25 left in my bank account to pre-authorise even if I'd agreed to. I only had a small quantity of cash on my person.So, late in the evening, with no way of getting home due to the trains having left, I was unable to access the hotel room I had paid for. By this point my 'phone was also on about 5% battery.Your staff were unwilling to do anything practical to assist me, such as making an alternative booking. Because you did not specify that a pre-authorisation was an absolute pre-condition of staying at Drakes, I paid for a hotel room I couldn't access, leaving me with insufficient funds to make an alternative booking.I was left without accommodation, on my own, in winter, overnight. I only had a shirt and blazer on, no coat. As my 'phone had run out of battery I was unable to contact friends or family to assist. I have bouts of sciatica due to my lower back sometimes being out of alignment. The cold can aggravate this and waiting all night until the trains re-started in the morning made my back particularly uncomfortable.Due to you not making me aware of Drakes' policy prior to paying, I was left without accommodation. You had the opportunity to help me find a solution, but you didn't, leaving me literally out in the cold all night in an unfamiliar town.My safety, and general health were put at risk. I could have been mugged, or otherwise attacked. What if a young woman had been in my position? Is this something Booking.com would be comfortable with? I am exceptionally unhappy and have serious concerns about your approach to guest safety in circumstances such as these. As things stand, I believe it could be in the public's interest to be aware of your approach. If I had a young daughter, I would be advising her to avoid your booking service because of these risks.I am looking for this problem to be corrected, and indeed for you to make restitution to me. I am giving you the chance to make this right. If you fail to see the importance of what happened last night, and don't make things better for me, then I will regard this as being a case it is in the public's interest to hear about. To that end I would write to the national press and relevant holiday and travel publications. I'm hoping I won't have to do that and I'm confident you will make this situation right for me.Yours sincerely,Mike ...'As things stand, I'll never use them again.",1,1,en,Bookingstar1

This was the biggest mistake I could make. Booking.com really doesn't care about individuals.I am being charged an illegal commission by booking.com repeatedly. The guest in question is a confirmed fraud by Booking.com. (I was given this information on the phone.) He apparently only books to block the dates of a property, never showed up, never cancelled, never paid. This booking was a NO SHOW. I HAVE NOT CHARGED THIS FRAUDULENT PERSON, NEITHER HAVE I RECEIVED ANY PAYMENTS. September 2021, I reported this guest and alerted booking.com that he was using different names on the platform, with the same message, phone number and pictures. I have been informed through the phone that, this was never picked up due to a glitch in the system. Also, was informed that all the other messages I sent afterwards were just ignored and marked as ""no actions required"". Why would I continuously send messages if no action is required?? Make it make sense please.. Honestly, this company is very incompetent and the customer service is the worst. All the evidence and proof is with Booking.com. Everything shows this commission is not correct, in order to waive the commission. I have called several times without any real form of help, cause apparently the customer service on the phone can't assist me. It's only the Finance department that can help, which is not reachable through phone only by message. THE FINANCE DEPARTMENT DOESN'T EVEN READ OR REPLY THESE MESSAGES. The situation is being prolonged for no reason. It's frustrating.Booking.com has acknowledged their mistake on phone numerous times, however absolutely nothing is being done to resolve the problem.We are in February 2022 now, and my request has not been resolved. Rather, Booking.com is sending me mails that they are going to take legal actions against me if I do not pay the commission.

They do provide a service but they do fraud as well - they sometimes charge you twice for your bookings and I am still fighting since 2018 to get my money refunded for being charged twice. Recommendation - stay away from this company and use other booking companies - there is a lot of competition.This is from my own experience in 2018: I have reserved and PAID directly via booking.com for the hotel (visible on my Paypal and Credit Card company summary). Once I've arrived at the hotel, the booking was there, but the Hotel said I have to pay as it's not being shown as paid - I said it should be, but I paid for the moment and decided to check that after my vacation. And so I did a couple of months later and found out that indeed I had been charged twice the same amoubt of money once as said via Paypal and Credit Card Company and the second time from my bank card on the day of checking in. I have been in contact with the hotel - they have required me to provide all the details - even though they do have all the details in their system and can see it all there, but I did provide everything again - no response after that - ever. Now I have been in contact with Booking.com hoping for a better experience - I forwarded them our emails with the hotel to booking.com - no response. After a few days I have asked if they have already found something out - they replied to me that they need more details on the hotel/date, etc - even though all of that information was already in the forwarded email. So I did add the details as they requested - then no response again for a long time. I wrote them again but still haven't received any response.If they can't resolve this in the next few days I will have to report them to the police. This is not what you would expect from a good company - a good company should resolve this for the customer without him having to do anything about this and not try to wait for ages so that the customer forgets - this indeed just shows that the company is a fraudulent company and is probably making millions of extra profit by scamming their customers like this (obviously from each hotel booking they only get some percentage, but if they charge you twice, they get a whole lot of profit).",1,0,en,Bookingstar1

Although Booking. Com has a refund policy with regards to COVID issues, the Hotel Management decided not to refund me, offering me another date which was impractical. They presumably know that Booking.Com will not allow me to review them as I did not stay there, and as such have little incentive to do so. I think that either Booking.com should change their COVID policy, allow reviews, or sub catagorise properties into those that do and those do not support their policy so as not to mislead customers in these trying times",1,0,en,Bookingstar1

Unfortunately, due to a health issue, the trip had to be canceled. At the time, we were given flight credits from American Airlines for the full amount that we paid for the tickets. When we tried to use the flight credits in January, we found out from American Airlines that they issued a full refund, totaling $639.60 to Booking.com on 12/28/21. They confirmed the amounts refunded along with the last 4 digits of the credit cards that received the refund.We contacted Booking.com and after numerous calls and emails, on 1/28/22 we were told that they would request that a refund be issued to us. That refund arrived yesterday, 2/15/22, for $216.

They said the deal was too large to be a Genius deal and they could not see it on the system. How convenient.They asked for a screenshot of the deal, however the only place that gave the breakdown of the deal is the same place that I would be putting my bank details in. Their app refuses to allow screenshots of this page due to 'privacy'.I explained this and they asked me to follow the same process, as if booking another room, to show the deal. I had booked the last Standard Double Room, so could not follow the same process. Even if it had worked, I would still be faced with the same issue as above with not being able to screenshot!Again, their customer service said the deal was larger than normal etc. and continued to try politely call me a liar.They will not refund me the £60 they owe me.

1041,Christina Jackson,unknown,2022-02-16T09:42:42.000Z,My most frustrating customer experience ever,"I made an online booking with Booking.com for a rental car in Milan Malpensa Airport. I wanted to switch rental car providers on the day of pickup, and I spoke with a very helpful and pleasant agent on the phone who made me a new booking and canceled my other one for a full refund. When I got the email confirmation though, the new booking was booked for Milan Linate Airport although I asked for Milan Malpensa Airport. Honest mistake, so I called back and asked for the same customer service representative as he was so helpful. They looked up who helped me with that booking and transferred me to him. He then apologized and admitted it was his fault and corrected it. He noted that it would be a roughly 10 EUR additional charge for the difference in price, which I was fine with. My next booking was correct, for Milan Malpensa Airport. Everything was great on the trip, and I was very satisfied with the service.Fast forward to after my trip, I saw that I had a 50 EUR charge on my card for a cancellation. I knew the first booking didn't have a cancellation fee, and I found out after talking to Booking.com that it was the mistaken booking at Linate Airport that the customer service representative on the phone booked for me that had a cancellation charge when he moved it to Malpensa Airport. The service rep hadn't mentioned any cancellation charge that would apply, and plus I don't see why I should be liable for a cancellation fee for a booking that I didn't ask for (I clearly asked for Malpensa Airport, and the agent made the mistake). I have since talked to 6 different people at Booking.com. On the phone they said they are not allowed to handle these kinds of refund questions, so they directed me to file the complaint online. I filed the complaint online on January 14. After two weeks of radio silence, someone finally responded and told me that I was mistaken and no customer service representative helped me on the phone and that I had made the changes myself online and that therefore the cancellation fee is correct. Odd, considering I think I would know if I called customer service and had these two conversations with them... and when I called back the second time the agent I got was able to easily look up in their system who had helped me before, and transfer me back to him!  So I know this information is in their system. Anyway, I was getting nowhere with the rep on email because he never responded to my first response back. Then I tried chatting on Booking.com and they also said they weren't able to help and that I needed to email this other email. The rep on chat also confirmed in writing that this was a mistake on Booking.com's part but that I had to go through e-mail. So I emailed the new email address, got one response asking me to confirm my identity as the main driver, and never heard from them again!  I have emailed 3 times over the past week and a half with absolute radio silence.This honestly feels like a strategy that Booking.com is employing to confuse and draw out the process until I get frustrated and give up. Terribly poor customer service via e-mail for refunds. I've never experienced anything like it before (where over a month goes by trying to get an issue resolved) which is why I have drawn the conclusion that this is a deliberate tactic. I do not recommend this company. Booking.com also should start allowing all their customer service reps via phone and chat to help solve customer problems.",1,1,en,Bookingstar1

All they did was call me to tell me there was nothing they could do and convince me everything was fine. The host page looks easy, but instead many aspects and features are hidden, twisted or disabled. Rightly so, the more convoluted something is, the more they can play with the rules, always saying 'yes, but then there's this other thing that says... and we can't do anything'. They also don't have accident insurance, which Airbnb does. Basically, if a client gets hurt, it's the host's problem and booking washes their hands of it. But it does it for everything.

In the cancellation policy, it was further mentioned, ""if cancelled, modified, or in the case of a no-show, the total price of the reservation will be charged.""But the property modified the booking for a later date without informing us. They changed it on the day we were due to check-in. By chance, I saw an email and then I phoned the property. They said they had given the apartments to someone else. We were travelling with our family, including 3 kids at the time. At that stage, we had no place to stay. We had to look for an alternative.If a customer cannot cancel, the same rules should apply to the property. But when this issue was raised with (booking.com), they ignored that our booking was modified and we had no place to stay. It appears that they only care about getting their cut.

1096,Anne,unknown,2022-02-07T00:19:43.000Z,Reneged on Promise of Refund,"I used booking.com in November 2021 to stay at Hyde Park Apartments, London - for myself and my two children. The owner of the property contacted me, via Booking.com’s platform, the day before arrival and demanded an additional £850 ‘fully refundable security deposit’. I contacted booking.com for advice and they told me they had checked all reviews and everything was positive and I could trust the proprietor. They advised me to proceed with the payment (which was via a bank transfer, hence my concern). On the day of arrival, the owner cancelled the booking a few minutes before the check in time, claiming the property had been ‘trashed’ by a previous occupant. My children and I were stranded in London with no accommodation (not the fault of BDC). For a few weeks I went back and forth with the owner on BDC’s platform trying to secure the £850 refund - to no avail. When I involved the police and a lawyer, BDC volunteered to take over and resolve it for me. They removed the site listing and all trace of the conversations between me and the owner. They tried to secure a refund from the owner and when this failed, they wrote to me to say they would refund me and then take action against the owner to reclaim their money. They asked me to provide evidence - bank statements etc. I provided everything they requested. Since then, I have entered the Kafka-esque nightmare of BDC’s customer service process. I have been batted from one agent to another week in week out. I get stuck on calls for 2-3 hours at a time, frequently getting cut off. Every interaction is Groundhog Day and I have to start the conversation from scratch as if they keep no records whatsoever. They ask me to resend the same evidence every single week. They wrote to me a month ago apologising for their error and assuring me that my refund was being processed. They sent a second letter stating I would have my refund within 5-7 working days. But a month later still no refund and still being asked to provide the same evidence. I have trawled through LinkedIn for everyone with customer in their job title and include all of these individuals in my emails - including their CEO - in the hope that an actual competent human being will resolve it. Not a single one has replied. I’ve never encountered anything quite like it. It’s too much money to lose and Booking.com are saying they will refund it.

It was dirty and hadn’t been cleaned although the person we dealt with, Adam, told us the cleaner had been in!  We couldn’t open the freezer baskets (apart from the fact they were completely broken anyway), as the huge build up of ice was impossible to shift. Adam advised us that they don’t always have time between guests to defrost but this hasn’t been done since the fridge was put in by the looks of it!  We didn’t use the kitchen cupboards as they were very dirty and a lot of greasy handles etc. The bathroom floor was disgusting as was the wall surrounding the shower. The sockets had a half inch of filth on them in the rooms. The windowsills have never been cleaned and the radiators were so filled with dust and hair that when the heating was on, it smelled like something was burning. There was no health and safety equipment in case of fire, no fire extinguisher or fire blankets. One of the blinds in the living room was broken. The sofa was dirty and extremely uncomfortable. The beds were clean and the towels were too but that is the only nice thing I can say about the flat. The mattress on the bed in the larger room had springs sticking up, making for a really uncomfy nights sleep. The flat itself is based right beside Lark Lane which is a fantastic area but even that couldn’t compel us to stay another night in this flat. If we had paid very little for the week, I would have been less angry about the lack of upkeep but in this instance I am disheartened at the sheer neglect of the place. Adam advised he’d given the cleaning company “ a rollicking”, but didn’t offer to get them back in to clean. He asked if we wanted him to come over but we were in town by then, eating out as we couldn’t eat in!!! The outside light is out too so it was very difficult to get the key in the lock after dark.

The hotel clearly had anti social behaviour problems as we were advised not to park are car near the building as people often throw cigarette buts, bottles and condoms out of the window. We entered the room and to cut a long story short it was in such disrepair that we immediately decided we would look for accommodation else where. I phoned booking.com who said that was fine and they would sort it out with the manager of the hotel so that we get a full refund. But guess what two days after the hotel refused the refund and booking.com took their word at face value and didn't even bother to investigate. I have since been promised a refund on several occasions and still received absolutely nothing. They also block 90% of bad reviews (as they have with mine) to inflate the reviews on their website.

1136,Ana Lulić,unknown,2022-01-30T14:42:17.000Z,"No solution to my customer request for 5 months, customer service is very bad","My experience with Booking.com started in September 2021. I booked a stay at a hostel in Zagreb, which was for a business trip, but I booked it as a private trip because I did not know at the time that my employer would later contact me and offer a refund if I was able to provide a VAT (""R1"" in Croatia) invoice. So, the refund would come from my employer, not as a refund from Booking.com - they would still get to keep my funds and that is fine by me. I first asked at the hostel while I was staying there, where they raised an eyebrow, checked the system and told me that, since I had booked via Booking, I needed to ask Booking directly. I do so, and in the following months, this happens: 1) October 2021 - I request an invoice via a form on their website - I receive a mail that asks me to write to their partneroffer invoices e-mail, I do so. A few days later, I get an automated answer saying I should request an invoice via the link in my booking confirmation. The issue is, this would give me a normal invoice, not a VAT invoice. 2) Still October 2021 - I decide to call their customer service (after spending hours online trying to find the local contact number), a lady picks up and tells me the same thing, she was reading from an internal note and translating it from English simultaneously, told me she can help me request the invoice via the e-mail link. It seems they had closed my ticket without anyone informing me that the internal department had left an answer to my request, and I had to actively call. I thank the agent and try to do it myself, as she seemed very new and insecure, and the form was quite clear. I add my company data and the e-mail of the company finance department. 3) November 2021 - I send another question via form because I received no invoice in the span of almost a month. I ask if it had maybe been a mistake listing my company's email rather than mine, if the invoice may have gone to my company's spam and if what I am asking is even possible to do. I receive quite a rude two-line e-mail from an agent telling me that it can take a while but he can't tell me how long. He does not reply to my other questions. 4) Late December 2021 - After receiving no document or info for another month, I submit a complaint to their conflict resolution center. I receive an e-mail very quickly, asking me for the details of my order, which I submit right away and even go so far as saying that I understand if they cannot answer quickly due to the holiday season. I attach my booking and payment proof. 5) Late January 2022 - After not receiving an answer for yet another month, I reply again and submit my info once more, this time without attachments in case they have caused my e-mail to not show up right in their system or something like that. A week has passed and I got zero replies and now my patience has reached its maximum. I work a similar job and understand backlogs, but receiving no answer except automatic e-mails and one solitary two-line e-mail within the span of 5 months really makes a consumer think that nobody works there or that nobody cares about one's issue. I am fully aware that what I am asking for is a borderline favor, but this is why I have underlined every e-mail I sent with ""I understand if what I am asking for cannot be done, just please inform me so I can inform my finance department before the fiscal year is up"". I have never received a reply to this question in what will almost be half a year soon. One positive thing I will say about them is that the website makes finding hotels convenient, but I will think twice before recommending Booking.com or booking via them again, as the negatives outweigh the positives by far. The nonexistent transparency is what hurts customer trust the most and I hope they do something to change the way they do customer support.",1,0,en,Bookingstar1

1152,Brae,unknown,2022-01-27T16:08:57.000Z,RUN!!!! WORST COMPANY EVER THEY REFUSE TO GIVE REFUNDS,"I booked a reservation through the holiday inn in mayfield Ohio through booking.com in July of 2020 I paid $200.90 .booking.coms site said they had a pool (which was the only reason we were going) but when I called the hotel they said they didn’t have one , so I cancelled my reservation (the same day). I requested a refund they told me they refunded booking.com and they would have refund me. So I repeatedly contacted booking.com when they finally responded they initially said I would have to get my refund from the holiday inn , then they said I had to send them proof of my reservation, then they said I had to send them proof that I REQUESTED A REFUND, I needed proof I paid. This is going on for months at this point! Then after I sent them all of my documents and the manager of the holiday inn contacted them, themselves and Confirmed EVERYTHING!!! They finally agreed to give me my refund. And my bank account is now closed because I disputed the charge with pnc and because booking.com never released the funds back to my bank, they reversed the credit and overdrew my account which eventually charged off my account! Immediately I told booking.com and sent them my mailing address and requested a paper check and asked them NOT to credit the account because it was closed ! I literally said this in the same email the representative sent SAYING THEY WOILD GIVE ME A REFUND! And she said the refund had already been processed and I would have to contact my bank. (Which I feel like is ridiculous because usually refunds take a couple days). I contact my bank MULTIPLE TIMES and they had never issued my refund EVEN THOUGH the representative said it had already been processed! When I called booking.com the representative told me the reason why I hadn’t gotten my refund was because my reservation was never cancelled…. At this point we’re in fall of 2020 . I knew again this was b.s. because I cancelled the same day and I spoke to them and provided this information already, so I AGAIN contact the holiday inn . I sent them their proof yet again, and they tell me they sent the refund i again ask them if it can be mailed. First they tell me they only deal with bank accounts they don’t do paper checks. And when I reminded them it couldn’t go to that account because it was closed they said they would contact the finance department give them the mailing address and see if I could get a paper check …. Of course, that didn’t happen ! I contact my bank and they FINALLY tell me that booking.com had tried to issue the refund but it had been rejected because the account was closed. (Keep in mind that at this time they had tried to issue the refund for a few months, but it wasn’t at all the time they were TELLING ME THEY ALREADY ISSUED IT). I call booking.com they ask for proof that the refunds were being rejected I sent it and AGAIN told them that the bank account has been closed and I’ve notified them via email and phone with my mailing address. Why keep sending a refund to an account that you KNOW no longer exist? Of course they just kept talking about their finance team and saying I needed to send them a copy of my last 6 statements , we’re well into 2021 at this point I go into the bank in person yet again , sit down with BOTH of the branch managers that I have been working with and at this point they can’t even go that far back. I tell booking.com they asked for proof that it was closed ? I’m not understanding, what they aren’t understanding…. You already have the proof of it being rejected and everything else ! But nevertheless… they were only able to pull up the LAST STATEMENT which was the official charge off from booking.com. I sent it to them and they just keep saying they sent the refund and I need to call my bank now I’m back at square one ! I’ve called pnc customer service, gone to pnc in person and contacted the holiday inn and it’s not even their fault ! Booking.com are con artists and have HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS. I just got off the phone with booking.com AGAIN and per usual they’re gonna contact their finance team, and I shouldn’t worry they assure me I’m going to get my refund . I calmly said Sir it’s 2022 , booking.com has caused me to lose my bank account, all types of debt collectors are calling me from pnc , I have kids , it’s a pandemic and I’ve been getting the run around from day one, at this point, you guys need to provide me with proof that you sent the refund WITH the account number showing , to see if it’s the same as the one that was provided it’s that simple.

When I gave them clear price match detail for detail they kept finding reason after reason to not honor the nearly $115 difference for my 2 night stay. I am very disappointed in my recent experience just because they were caught in several lies and just wouldn’t admit to the fact that they were wrong and wouldn’t give me my full credit. I’m never one to try and get something given or refunded unless I have throughly done my research I also included the hotel which they didn’t like this is how I knew several of the things they claimed were incorrect.

But this happened during the last holydays1) One of the hotel booked canceled the reservation hours before my arrival, therefore no place to sleep. This website has NO responsibility over the customers that use their platform and rely on the reservation made2) Some system/robot sent me some properties alternatives but, all of them where simple terrible. I replied by email to asking a phone number to speak with someone. NO person available to talk and solve the issue, only non-sense replies from automatic systems. 3) Another of the hotel that I reserve which was listing in their platform was locked, YES the hotel was closed. Obviously I canceled. Once again, I took time from my vacations to find for another hotel. This website doesn’t care if the hotel/property is legit or not4) Because point 1,2,3 are their responsibility, I asked for compensation. It was denied without any explanation5) I closed booking.com account from my end, but as of today the account stills open, of course this will hurt its churn ratios, despite the fact that I sent at least 4 emails asking to close the account immediatelyThis company is a middleman with no professional ethics at all, no shame and managed by crooks and their practices is reflected even on their personnel, they don’t even response clearly the questions, they just copy past some nonsense script I already raise this situation to the USA authorities, at least at some point they will pay for their unethical practices",1,2,en,Bookingstar1

By 2.45pm the driver had not arrived so we called the company with details provided - no one answered. We then contacted Booking.com on the 24/7 phone line. I spoke to a Samantha, whom stated whilst I was on the phone, she had contacted the company who claimed to be outside the hotel - which they were not- Samantha stated the company would ring me once my phone call with her had ended. We waited a further 15mins for this phone call which did not happen. By this time it is 3pm, half hour after the confirmed pick up time. Understandably we were now been made to feel fairly stressed.I had to ring Booking.com again, this time I spoke to Amar who stated he had no information on my previous call, therefore i had to repeat my issue again, he also stated he had no information or contact details for ""Samantha"" whom I had spoken to 15minutes prior. All this time was increasing pressure to ensure we would get to the airport in time for our flight.Amer again stated he would try and contact the taxi company whilst I was on the phone - I waited 20 minutes on hold and got no answer. Due to call rates, each of these phone calls cost me a total of £54.79 which had they provided an adequate service I would not have had to make.Eventually an hour after our prearranged time, we had received no communication from booking.com or the taxi company, feeling incredibly anxious that a journey on a Friday during rush hour to the airport can take longer than expected and a plane to catch we felt forced to pay another fee of $70 plus $20 tip for another taxi service. This again was additional money that we did not expect or want to have spent.The whole experience left me and my partner exceptionally distressed - not the ending to a holiday we had hoped for. Traveling especially during these times is already stressful enough with different rules and regulations changing constantly. So its incredibly unnerving when you receive such an unreliable and incomeptant service from Booking.com. It was the last thing we needed.My experience with Booking.com has negatively impacted my confidence within travel industry, and certainly will not be a using Booking.com for airport taxi service again in any future travels and i certainly intend to share my dreadful experience with others.Communication was awful and when we eventually got home we put a complaint in to customer service.

1199,Rachel Bull,unknown,2022-01-19T08:28:36.000Z,Non existent  customer service and unclear terms,"I do not recommend booking.com, I have used them for a number of years but on a recent trip to Sri Lanka where I needed assistance I was left completely on my own. Customer service weren’t willing to help, and any response you get in text almost seems to be automated - not answering the questions that you have asked. I found the service poor both for a trip booking and also for a hotel room booking, it really felt likeBooking.com don’t care about you at all once they have your money. Hotel booking - We arrived at a hotel to find dirty sheets, a door that wouldn’t lock, white stains all over the bed spread and brown stains on the bathroom wall (this wasn’t a common occurance in Sri Lanka). The man on reception also didn’t speak any English and didn’t seem to know that we were coming. As we arrived late we had to stay here for the night (we had a terrible nights sleep and literally slept in our clothes). We had booked 3 nights but were going to leave early morning. I contacted booking.com by telephone to ask if they could make sure that if we left and paid for 1 night that we wouldn’t get charged for the other two nights (I think even paying for 1 night was unfounded but we just wanted to leave without fuss). The person I spoke at booking.com was no help at all and said I had to sort this out with the staff at the hotel (which was difficult due to the language barrier) we were also quite upset by this point as we were on our honeymoon and didn’t want an uncomfortable situation. We managed to pay for one night and leave however. Since then I have received an email from booking.com asking if we stayed 3 nights, and when I said no it requested information on why, do they not make notes of conversations and complaints?! Really terrible service, so frustrating as once you have booked customer service is literally appalling and you are on your own.Trip Booking - we booked two safaris on two separate days (one morning and one evening) for a cost of 90 US a trip, there was no mention when we booked of any additional costs that would need to be paid. When we set of on the safari we reached the park gate and we’re asked for an additional £30 (approx) for a park entry fee. Not an insignificant sum after already spending 90 US, and we had not been made aware of this when booking. This caused confusion with our driver who didn’t speak much English and gave everyone a bit of stress, we also saw other tourists who booked with booking.com having the same issue. We were not prepared for this cost and had no cash with us, so I had to use my card which I was luckily carrying but this also meant expensive foreign transaction fees. If we had know about this we would have only booked one safari, or both on the same day as we were now faced with this unexpected charge on our next safari too. I tried to get in touch with booking.com initially by chat but this is apparently not an option for trip bookings. So I sent an email and got a cryptic reply that didn’t really answer my complaint and query, following this booking.com asked me to rate the response I received of which I rated it unsatisfactory and again detailed my experience and complaint. This was a waste of my time, as I was then sent an identical reply from a different agent. We are quite reasonable people and not usually one to take the time to complain but I have really found that for such a huge company booking.com seem to have zero morals and zero care for their customers. It’s a shame because the app is pretty good and easy to use, but customer support to back this up it’s useless.",1,0,en,Bookingstar1

About my case: I was their user for a while, I have 2 accounts (for me and my wife) and I am frequent traveller.I booked a room in US for a couple days. When I came to the place, it turned out to be so bad, that my wife cried and I had to leave it quickly and book again something else (I spent there maybe 1/2 hour, I had a booking for nearly 2 weeks).In short, ugly, terrible place like 3m x 1,5m with bunk bed (advertised as ""double bed""), dirty toilet shared with X guests, in different floor than then room and even far from the stairs, place completely ignoring covid 19 restrictions (which was a problem for me because I am from UK and I had to pass number of covid tests and be covid-free to be able to come back to UK), obviously no TV, no internet etc. just slums.Then I contacted the accommodation's manager and booking.com and asked for refund. The accommodation refused saying ""no refund"" (kind of their business strategy, first they provide fake ratings, pictures looking different than then place then they use booking.com - the biggest scammer in business, so e.g. on all other websites, the same accommodation has 1 star or 2 stars, while on booking.com they have proud 3 stars and 30 x more reviews than on competitors website probably because of that). (find out more reading about ""fake ratings"" under below links or on Trustpilot).Then I contacted booking.com (because I purchased the service on their website). In short, I have been emailing, chatting and calling them many times and all the time I heard ""it is accommodation"" or ""they are refusing"" etc. etc.I also asked to explain, why booking.com maintain this fake 3 stars rating for such place, I was told that ""the hotel or 3rd party provider provides its own rating"". Interesting.Finally, after few days they stopped replying to me (on all channels, mail, contact form, chat) and they disabled chat option on my account (I know because I have other account as well). When I called them, they hanged up and then, called me back and when I picked up, then they were pretending that something is wrong with the connection (like you would speak to the phone from 1 meter distance) and again hanged up.I imagine, that its not that the person who works hard in their customer service is guilty here, because I called some ""local CS"" from different city in US. I guess they simply have some ""procedures"" like probably they just tag some customers as ""don't talk to him"" or ""customer claiming refund"" or something and then those poor people working on CS have to follow that.I was surprised seeing how they actually operate. It is giant company, registered on NASDAQ, I receive business ads like ""invest in booking.com"" and they have methods like some Easter European mafias, they call you, then hang up, they disable chat or contact form, I guess a few more emails and they are gonna poison my dog or shoot to my windows from AK47 in the middle of the night. I lost a lot of money and will never open their and related app or website again (Kayak, Priceline, Agoda, OpenTable, and RentalCars).I plan to move ahead with my case and engage some legal actions here and I will also complain on this to relevant authorities and I will describe in my other comment where I sent my complains, why, what was the result of that and how to do that, so other people can also try not to be cheated.

Sorry.There is no other company on the whole entire Trustpilot with SO MANY complaints and so bad rating (1.3 in a scale 1.0 - 5.0 and with almost 30`000 reviews!), Almost 60% of rates are ""bad"" (the worst one) and first X comments from top to bottom are complaints one by one.They cheat their customers on EVERY FIELD and that gives them an advantage over their competitors (e.g. Expedia).There are thousands of reports for:- compromised credit cards and frauds (booking.com does not take any responsibility for anything and maintain fake ratings and fake accommodations with 0 control on them, so you might think that you do the right thing typing your credit card number in the form on their website, but in reality, it is being shared directly with your accommodations with all your data!So considering the way how they operate - your card might have just been printed somewhere in some fishy hostel in the middle of Amazon Jungle (e.g. like mine, I saw my credit card printed on paper in Amsterdam a couple years ago, on top of the stack of other prints, right in front of me).- fake accommodations and fake ratings (perhaps that is why they still have 1.3 / 5 but not 1.0 / 5)- problems with hotels/hostels cheating people which booking.com still supports against their customers and despite many complaints- problems when an accommodation looks very different in place than on pictures or looks terrible or is unsafe and booking.com still offers it against their customers, despite complaints- problems with refunds/cancellations, frauds from 3rd party services etc.- manipulations on prices, offers, offers availability, descriptions etc.- problems like e.g. hidden cameras in some accommodations- number of other problems (see comments on Trustpilot and some links below)Sooner or later, they will cheat you too. Probably a few times you will successfully find an accommodation there and then, one day... whenever you will have any problem, with anything, ... you will see how it really works.In short, they way how it works is: They are interested in only you to pay for something, room or car etc. Then they pass your credit cards and data to your accommodation or service provider and they take their commission (very high one, see links below, sometimes it turns out to be up to 40%). Now the job is done...Since then, if anything happen to you, its entirely your problem.What they give you (for up to 40% of what you pay) is a browser with hotels and cars.There is absolutely no responsibility on their side and you have no warranty for anything whenever you use their website.Also, they cheat as well customers, as well hotels and on every field as well, so complains come not only from customers, but actually from hotels too.For example they charge hotels aggressively (see links below) or e.g. they maintain fake ratings, e.g. in my case I paid similar money for one of the most famous, branded hotel with 3 stars and almost the same money for some fishy, ugly hostel with also 3 stars and in the same city and the same day! (because I had to change because when I came to the place, it turned out to be too ugly to stay there).So, imagine that you are the owner of this expensive hotel and you pay high taxes, licences, franchises, you provide number of services like room service, 24h reception, phones, TV, a lot of other things and you have to pay number of other fees and you have 3 stars on booking, the same as some ""fake hostel"" which doesn't have to pay anything and is actually unlicensed and unregistered but it has 3 stars as well and it has similar prices like you (the only difference is that it has photoshopped pictures on booking).Here some sources to see: - type on google ""is-booking-com-scam""? (from happilyevertravels )- see other complaints on ""complaintsboard""- type ""booking misleading sales tactics"" (from cnn)- type ""travel news hotels spain take legal actio against booking"" (from express)- see topics ""Beware booking reviews"" and ""Booking and credit card security"" (tripadvisor)I lost a lot of money and will never open their and related app or website again (Kayak, Priceline, Agoda, OpenTable, and RentalCars).

None of the advisors actually know the policy, I’ve spoken to about 15 different people who have told me 1 million different things, I’ve spoken to 2 managers who have confirmed that their staff have given out incorrect information. By the time I receive the refund (if I ever actually do!) it will have been over a month since the issue started. I Wish I would’ve come onto the review section before I went with Booking.com as overall 57% of reviews are diabolical 4% a poor 7% average 4% are good and a measly 27% are great. This completely sums up my terrible experience with this company. They are representing the OYO who have different branches around the country when they can’t actually get a hold of them to initiate a refund. However they chose to keep being partners with them! And you can easily book a hotel room with one of their branches. Countless advisors and managers Have tried to contact this company who by the way I have contacted easily and had immediate responses from but booking.com cannot seem to negotiate or even hold a conversation with this company. At the start of this predicament I spoke to an advisor who told me it was company policy for their partner company to reply to them within 24 hours four or five more advisors after that told me the same thing however when I spoke to the manager for the first time he told me actually it was five working days! Not good enough train your staff correctly! I was told by an another advisor that my refund would be issued within 7 to 12 working days I called five days later just as a check up call to see where they’re at and was disappointed to find out that they needed more confirmation from the OYO before they even process the refund which I had been told they already had. I then had to contact the OYO myself because booking.com were to incompetent to do so. I then had to send screenshots of my conversation with OYO to booking.com so they can verify it with their finance team as they apparently cannot get a response yet they aren’t chasing anything to receive a response. I’m now going to have to wait another two working days for them to review and decide whether that’s good enough for them to then initiate the refund which will take 7 to 12 more working days.

I had to apply one star here in order to make a review but booking.com do not deserve even one star.  I am writing this review in the hope that others will see it and know to steer clear of booking.com so that they will not have to endure the trauma that we had at the hands of booking.com.We had a committed booking with a hotel in a ski resort on booking.com that we fully paid at the end of November 2021 (we paid €6k for 4 rooms on 30th of November and at that point once payment was made, the money was non-refundable) yet when we arrived, (exhausted after travelling since 4 a.m.) we were told that only 2 rooms were available.  We were then sent to another hotel an hours' drive away which created a whole series of inconveniences regarding hire of ski equipment/ money paid that has not yet been refunded etc.  There was no adequate explanation given with both the hotel and booking.com blaming the other. It seems as though either the hotel or booking.com were gambling that we would not be able to travel due to Covid so saw fit to re-let our room.Having arrived at the hotel at 3.30 in the afternoon and watched other selected customers get keys to their rooms we were sent to a hotel in a location that we had not chosen (and did not want to be in) at 6 p.m. that evening.  The whole experience was not just traumatic and stressful but appalling from the point of view of customer service.  When we informed booking.com their response was that ""this is definitely not something we would like our guests to experience"" - a pallid, lack-lustre response which suggests that they have no appreciation of the stress and anxiety caused or simply don't care.  We have been relocated on booking.com reservations in the past but to properties ""across the road"" in cities like London - not an hours drive to another resort and not where the booking had been fully paid over one month in advance. In summary, Booking.com seriously breached their commitment to provide us with 4 rooms which merits more than a ""we apologise for the inconvenience and discrepancy"". We suffered the following:1. embarrassment while we were put to one side at the hotel reception and eventually told to go to another hotel. Why were we the ones selected to be turned away? Why were we dealt with in such an unsatisfactory way in full view of the public. I can only assume other ""successful"" guests thought our credit was refused2. we had to rearrange ski hire at short notice and higher expense - an additional cost of €6823. we had to cancel and re book COVID related travel tests at the new location.",1,0,en,Bookingstar1

They also said that they had no other cars available for us at this time. At this point we had the 7 of us plus a baby, with no car seat (car seat was part of the rental agreement) in a country where we had limited phone service options and resources and unable to get a large enough car for the week that we would be staying there...From when we landed to when we got to the budget kiosk it took 1.5 hours, due to the long holiday lines at immigration and customs.

My problem with this is that apparently they use the arrival time of your flight as the pickup time, making it nearly impossible (especially during the holidays) to make it from the gate to the car rental kiosk in under an hour... my family was forced to find other travel accommodations at a far greater cost that wasn't even large enough to fit everyone so we were forced to drive around with family members and a baby that were improperly secured in the vehicle.Both budget and booking.com said that they stood by this ludicrous policy and that they would not be refunding us the $500 for the rental that we never received. We will not be using either of these services again, and hope that this information helps others in their decision making while looking for companies to aid them in their travel plans.",1,0,en,Bookingstar1

One agent even stated ‘does it have to be in the same city?’. They couldn’t find any suitable accommodation as the prices had all risen to an amount that booking and the original property were unwilling to cover so we are now left with non-refundable flights, car hire and transfers for a city break with no accommodation!

I have booked flights for both my son and husband separately via booking.com to Poland in the beginning of December.  However, we have found out the inbound flight coming back to UK, the check in luggage was always not done even I had already paid in my bookings.  My son's trip was a bit lucky as I managed to make a couple of calls and added his check-in luggage before he flew out to Poland.  But for my husband's trip it was really a disaster.  At the end his luggage was not added and he had to pay to the airline himself just a few hours before the flight take off.  Every time I called booking.com and they told me that the inbound flight check in luggage will be added when check-in was available.  However, it didn't make sense at all as my son and husband were flying with Ryanair and they could have checked in anytime if we paid for it and no need to wait 24 hours before the flight take off.  Because my husband's check-in luggage was not done so he could not check-in.  He waited just 24 hours before the flight and we had made at a few calls to booking.com to chase that.  At the end just before a few hours the flight take off, I was told that they were unable to add the check-in luggage and my husband had to purchase it himself.  Luckily my husband managed to do it online before check-in otherwise he could have paid  £65 for his luggage in the airport.Then we needed to follow up for the refund, the money we had already paid for our check-in luggage to booking.com which the service had not been delivered, and the extra we had paid to buy the check-in luggage ourselves.I have tried to write a complaint at booking.com website and i received e-mails automatically saying I need to call the flight department.  But when I called the flight department they said they didn't know anything about the emails I received. My husband has  sent the invoice for the luggage purchase to the refund department but nothing had been heard for nearly a month.  And my complaint didn't go anywhere as it turns out that booking.com was using GoToGate for flight bookings, it is under the umbrella of etraveli.com.  What on earth I would know all about this?  They have never mentioned, so I had to file the complaint to etraveli and I can just file online which I have no idea what the booking reference was using between booking.com and etraveli.com, so I was unable to file a complaint.   I have to say it is totally a mind-field.    This is the most unsatisfied,   frustrated and stressful experience I have ever had with any travel agents.  The most frustrating things are1.  I was told we need to call to add the check-in luggage even we were abroad and we have already paid for the service up-front  I have told them that don't assume every can make call abroad and it may cost a lot to customers making call abroad should be just for emergency and nothing should be already paid and planned2.  there is no way to talk to anyone who can address my issue directly, they will just keep re-directing me to send an email or website which no one will get back to you3. They should have refunded the amount of money automatically with the service which had not been delivered and not sure why they needed a receipt for the refund4. I have spoken to around 10 of the customer services, each of them giving me different answers.  Some said the case has been escalated and will get back to me in 48 hours.  But nothing happened. and when I requested to talk to their supervisors, some of them just didn't reply at all and kept silence until I hanged up5. in booking.com there is no way to talk to anyone unlike expedia or opodo I can always find someone I can talk to and address my issues when needed6. Price wise, booking flight with booking.com is not even a lot cheaper than booking the flight with Ryanair directly if I book directly with Ryanair I will be sure that my luggage will be checked in as I planned for.Now, I won't book any flight with booking.com anymore as i will never be sure my check-in luggage has been done correctly as I have paid for.  I think I will be likely not using booking.com anymore due to the confidence I have totally lost from these experiences.I have asked one of the customer services about giving me a reason why I should choose booking.com next time if first price wise I am not really better off and second I don't receive the service I have already paid and on the top it creates a lot of hassle and stress which should not be happened.

My review was highly critical,  as you will see if you read it.  My issue for Booking.com is that my review of this property, along with a whole raft of others in the last 6 months, whilst uniformly highly critical and therefore important to people seeking to book accommodation, disappear from the Booking.com site for this property and can only be seen if Negative reviews are specifically requested.  This means that negative review are hidden, perhaps deliberately hidden, from users of the site.  This  fatally undermines the usefulness of Booking.com as potential customers do not see all the relevant information unless they seek it out, and it is hard to find.  Specifically the selection of reviews shown as ""Most Relevant"" appears to eliminate ALL highly critical reviews, rendering the overall review score and rating meaningless.

1314,Brendan ,unknown,2021-12-31T18:53:37.000Z,Pathetic customer service from booking.com,"I booked a twin room with kitchenette for 2 weeks in Warsaw on booking.com.  I specifically wanted a room with a kitchenette so I could do my own catering as a solo traveller. On arrival, there was no kitchenette. I wrote to both the apartment agency which is ""Business Studio Apartments Wolska by Renters"" and Booking.com. I requested a change of room to what I paid for or a refund. All the replies were apologies and an offer of paying a substantial extra amount to get a room with a kitchenette. The room was sold under false pretences. Booking.com customer service now deny that their site ever showed that a kitchenette was offered with the twin room. They had 2 weeks to change my room. I wrote to them almost every day and it totally spoiled my trip. If i got a refund, I could have gone elsewhere but they didn't do that. Also, when booking, for some reason ""Renters.pl"" didn't accept a credit or debit card despite my bank saying that there was no reason to refuse my cards. They offered an option to do an international transaction. I sent the money in PLN Polish currency and before they would allow me to get the key, they wanted proof of payment. I sent a screenshot but that wasn't sufficient. They needed a pdf. I sent that and all was ""well"" until a few days later when they requested extra money and if it wasn't paid, they would cancel my booking. No coherent explanation was made as to why I had to pay extra money. I didn't pay because I paid what they requested in the beginning. I would urge anyone thinking of going to Poland to be wary of this crowd. If I paid by credit card, I could have got a refund and I think that's why they refused a card payment. They are tricky customers and booking.com were extremely disappointing because apologies don't solve a problem. Needless to say, I won't be using booking.com in the future.

That same evening I wrote to Booking.com describing what happened and asked for help recovering our payment. That is when we learned that Booking.com would not stand by you if anything went wrong. They said that they could not do anything, even though they had brokered this reservation. They were protecting the hotel.

We had been traveling around Canary islands, mostly staying in privately rented apartments. But for the New Year 28 Dec - 3 Jan we booked the apart hotel Coral Compostela Beach Golf via booking.com. The chosen hotel moved us to another accommodation last minute because of the double booking (!) without our consent!As it happened on a short notice, all the properties in the area were fully booked.We refused the suggested option (the new place was further from the town center and the beach) and tried to seek help from booking.com. However we spent almost 3 hours communicating with them and waiting in the parking lot. No help whatsoever!The first agent we talked to for 30 mins made us wait for the property response on his request. Of course the property didn't reply, and he didn't call us back either. So I had to call again myself. After that I've spent over 45-50 mins on the phone. The line got disconnected multiple times (just went silent).  But Booking.com people don't call back themselves!!! Had to call back as we were desperate.The agent was super slow, finally suggested a place far from where we planned to stay because they were trying to match the original price I paid booking in advance. Ridiculous to expect the last minute booking for the New Year in the popular area to be the same as booked in advance.After yet another disconnect I just gave up. I feel rather helpless as they don't provide any help in the cases like ours whatsoever.At the end we went with whatever was offered by the hotel management as we were incredibly tired after a day of traveling. We spent 1.5 hours purely on the phone, had to call them back a few times and had nothing resolved!!The room in the substitute hotel is bad, on the first floor, people passing by all the time.I used another website for apartments renting for the rest of beginning of our holiday.

First the concierge at the hotel was racist and wasnt convinced I was American so he decided to ask me to pay in cash for my reservation and then called the police on me because he thought I was illegal. When I called to report it to Bookings the phone service was only allowing calls to take money from you and not assist in any type of emergency. Thanks to their negligence I have had to hire an attorney to sue the hotel and have filed  complaints with consumer affairs and BBB. My lawyer has also contacted them both parties.,1,3,en,Bookingstar1

He noticed that they charged him twice when he arrived. The hotel manager confirmed this and advised him to contact Booking.com to correct it. It was a nightmare getting in touch with them - they wanted a PIN, that we’d never had. Took forever to get that sent over, before they’d speak to us (even though we had booking reference).We eventually spoke with a customer service rep who emailed us a link to send over proof of the double payment. Why a large tech company such as Booking.com are not able to see this themselves is unbelievable!This was all sent over in September, nothing back at all!We started a case with Resolver and they have been responding (kind of) - asking for the same information over & over. They have been trying to email me outside of the Resolver system but I am replying to them via Resolver in order to keep a clear log for when it escalates.It’s not that much money to them - approx £120 but they just seem to be delaying as much as possible in the hope we go away.It’s now end December 2021 and we still don’t have his money back.

1354,Tony Warcus,unknown,2021-12-26T15:49:57.000Z,Booking.com's abysmal Taxi arrangements,"Having used Booking.com for many years, I have had no problems with its core service as a platform for hotel bookings. There’s a wide choice to suit all budgets. But I have recently had cause to question its ability to communicate effectively with its local partners on behalf of the customer – in my case this relates to a taxi service I booked on its platform to take me from my hotel in Paris to the Gare du Nord for my return journey on Eurostar. To summarise: I booked the taxi when I made my hotel booking as my train would be leaving early in the morning of 23 December. Two days before my scheduled departure, I realised I needed to leave an hour earlier than originally scheduled. I requested a change through the My Booking app. I then received a text direct from the local cab service confirming my booking but giving the original, not the amended, pickup time. Concerned there’d been a misunderstanding, I contacted the Booking.com Customer Service through the app and got an email confirmation from a customer service representative that the taxi would arrive at the earlier time I’d requested. But…I got a second text from the taxi service quoting the original and now wrong time.   I emailed the customer services representative again, pointing this out, but got some reassurance from her reply confirming the amended time for the pickup.  On the morning I was due to leave I received an automated email direct from Booking.com stating the driver would be meeting me at the amended time. But…no one turned up. I was unable to get through to anyone at the taxi firm and all a Booking.com customer services representative could do when I emailed was to ask if I’d heard from the driver. After waiting for 25 minutes outside the hotel in the cold I made my way to the Gare du Nord by the metro and thankfully wasn’t too late for my train which had been a worry given the added checks which have to be carried out due to the pandemic. I later received texts from the taxi service that a taxi driver was on his way and then a voicemail that he’d waited for me and was now cancelling the trip – this was around the original pickup time. It’s impossible for me to guess what Booking.com’s back-office processes are like - but everything points to it being unable to ensure its local partner had the updated details. At 13:34 on my return home, I emailed Booking.com, giving a detailed timeline of events. I notified the firm I was complaining about the lack of service I received and requested a refund of the taxi fare (£26.88). Not having a response, I chased this at 21:43, asking for someone to take ownership of this issue. A reply, which failed to acknowledge my complaint was received at 22:56 stating: “Sorry for what happen. (sic) I will assure you this won't be happen again. If there is anything else I can assist you with please let me know. I hope you have a pleasant journey.” It is unclear if this emanated from an algorithm designed to identify certain key words and improvise a template response – or from a real person with limited understanding and interest in what went wrong. I have not heard anything further.  I assume Booking.com’s Taxi department has shrugged off this incident. It is clearly not worth my while pursuing, given the small sum that effectively has gone down the drain (though the principle of having paid for a service not received remains).I shudder to think what would have happened if someone with a lot of luggage, or a young family, had been involved.",1,3,en,Bookingstar1

We informed the owner beforehand that we had a cat. She replied- no problem, I will give you a room with a terrace, it would be more comfortable for the cat. When we arrived, and this was during a massive heat wave with the temperatures reaching 40s, and with a tired animal in the car, the owner took us to a horrible room in a private part of the house, very shabby, no a/c, toilet outside, most amenities we paid for - missing. She refused to give us a fan. The ‘ terrace’ was not usable, like a glass box from hell where the temperature reached catastrophic levels and again everything was nasty and shabby. Shower was literally in the room. The worst accommodation I had ever stayed in, ever. We asked for a reduced rate as the room we got was much worse than what we paid for, and we had no way of even suspecting this would happen as the room we got wasn’t mentioned on the website. The owner refused.We tried calling Booking several times but could not reach customer service.We were charged €250 for two nights in this nightmare place, and a cat supplement to add an insult to injury.When we contacted Booking again to try to solve this, they just washed their hands off the problem and said they can’t help us now becuse we didn’t inform them right away. Well, we tried but it being a weekend in France, no one was available.Anyway, in their success, they have completely left customer service behind. What happened to us was unfair and unacceptable. The owner cheated us. Had she told us ahead of time that we would get such a poor quality room for the same price, we would have simply gone somewhere else. But tired after a long drive and with an old animal in the car we simply didn’t have the energy to start looking around an unfamiliar French rural area in the dead of August.Booking.com should have stopped the owner from taking all that money from us, cheating, and re-renting the room we paid for to someone else. Disgusting and unacceptable. Unhelpful and indifferent customer service.I’ve later had different issues with customer service too.

I proceeded to call my airline and waited ANOTHER 2 HOURS for my airline to tell me there's nothing I can personally do but instead, I would need Booking.com to call on my behalf to cancel if I wanted a refund. That made me EXTREMELY disappointed cause I wasted four hours TOTAL of waiting time to only be asked to call back Booking.com?

Unable to find alternative accommodation for the day of arrival (no joy from the front desk at the hotel), we booked alternative accommodation for the next 2 nights, making it clear to the hotel three times how deeply unhappy we were. We have requested a refund of 70%, not 75% which is what we'd be entitled to. We have spent hours on the phone to Booking.com, poor customer service, frequent rudeness, promises to call back and they don't. The hotel finally agrees last week to a 70% refund but only if we remove our poor review. This we do. The refund arrives- less than 50%.

I didn’t use the nights and the hotel can re-sell the room. Instead the hotel has stolen my money.

The hotel we picked had a high price tag for the area but the pictures looked fairly good and for a last minute event we went ahead and booked. When we arrived around 11:30 pm and checked in we became instantly suspicious of the property as it looked different than the pictures represented on the site. When we got to the room our suspicion was verified by the absolutely disgusting room both in furnishings and cleanliness so as soon as the office opened back up we canceled the rest of our reservation and found a new hotel. The front desk confirmed they had refunded the money back to Booking.com and it could take up to 30 days to get the money back to my account.This was in October it is now December and Booking.com is barely doing anything to get us our money in the ballpark $600.00  numerous calls have gone with no reply other than they don’t know why our funds haven’t been put back in the account, The hotel will not speak with us because Booking.com is who booked the room not us (I’m sure that’s not true but Booking.com is responsible since they were who we paid). Thanks to Booking.com dragging out the reply process I can’t just contest the charge with my financial institution and to top it all off after we made Booking.com aware of the problems with the hotel, the pictures and other provided information on their site being criminally inaccurate they took down the listing then put it back up a few days later with no real change except a few new reviews.",1,1,en,Bookingstar1

The place cost £992.32 a week which I was only willing to tolerate because, a) that weekend in particular was quite busy and, b) the photos were shot at an angle that made the apartment look habitable. When I got there, the whole apartment (most notably, the kitchen) smelled like a toilet, there was basically no insulation and the bedroom looked rundown and diseased! I genuinely believe that the flat could have a pest problem. Regardless, it looked very easy to break into and not safe for a woman traveling alone.As I had issues with phone battery and later issues with my network reception, I prioritised finding a last minute replacement and messaged both booking.com and the property owner once a more suitable accommodation was found about an hour or so after check-in. I received no response from the property owner and booking.com's customer support team assured me that they would handle this.I tried emailing the property owner the next day and still no response from him.The day after that I was able to get a signal strong enough to make phone calls. When I spoke to the owner, he insisted that he hadn't received any of my messages (both in the app or via email) and that booking.com had not contacted him. He then directed me to speak to booking.com about getting the refund.When I called booking.com, they said that they had tried to get in touch with the property owner but that he wasn't responding to their emails or phone calls. The person I spoke to seemed to understand that this was suspicious and said that this would be escalated to another team. It was maybe a week later (after a several phone calls back and forth) that it became apparent that the matter hadn't been escalated on their end at all.Eventually I received an email from a support agent saying that they would only issue a refund for the first night even though I hadn't spent a single night in the property. I received this email on the day of a flight that I had booked so I quickly wrote an honest review of the ""Luxury"" apartment and contacted the property owner via WhatsApp shortly afterwards. The property owner then told me that because I'd written the review, he would not issue a refund at all. A little later that day, I called Booking.com again to address the email that I received and the property owner's temper tantrum. The customer support agent insisted that no decision had been made about my case and didn't seem to know where the earlier email could have come from. They also agreed that the property owner's behaviour was clearly unacceptable and assured me that this would be taken into account when a final decision was reached.I waited for them to review the case and kept asking for an update. They assured me that a conclusion would be reached within 30 days of when the case was actually escalated.It has now been 30 days and not only has a decision not been reached but today I found that booking.com deleted my review of the property. The property still appears on their website and it is still possible to book a stay at the ""Slateford House Luxury Apartment"" but the review I wrote back in November (and I suspect at least one of the other negative reviews) was removed without notice. When I contacted the customer support team again, they denied that the review had ever been posted (even though there was written evidence to the contrary). From what I can tell, they seem to be actively protecting a rogue landlord who falsely advertised a property that was likely to be unsafe (if not just unhygienic). They also appear to be keeping the money to do who knows what with.I don't think I will be waiting much longer for a response from them at this rate. An ongoing visa dispute has been raised and I will be reporting the matter to the Financial Ombudsman in due course. As this seems to be a clear case of fraud (and not even the first that I've run into on booking.com this year, unfortunately), I will be discussing next steps with my lawyer and will likely involve the police as well.My advice to others: DO NOT under any circumstances use this company! They will waste your time and protect partners who will steal your money. They will mislead you about who has your money at various points in the process and make contradictory statements in order to buy time. Then to top it off, they'll delete all evidence of the fact on their end, allowing their partners to scam others later on. Just a disgrace all around!",1,1,en,Bookingstar1

Mostly, my stays are OK ish but I have noticed that the more I use this site to book the more the accommodation rankings don't reflect the stars stated. Often I have been to 9 plus places and found the standards adequate at best. For others a 7 and the service fantastic. My latest encounter is with a 9.5 B&B and I made a few basic and certainly not unreasonable requests, as the site allows when you book a place to stay. The properietor then rang up, and in a hostile tone deterred me from staying after all because he had never received demands like mine: 1. TV remote works, 2. shower has hot water, 3. more than one socket to charge a phone. That sort of thing. Apparently, that made me a fussy diva not worthy of their 9.5 star B&B. Apprently, asking for basic amenities to work was expecting 5 star service they could not or would not provide and I should go elsewhere. Yet comments from those who had stayed mentioned that the proprietors had accommmodated Earl Grey tea and vegan choices. The whole site is a scam. Now I just pinch the names and ring the hotel direct and get a few quid off.",1,0,en,Bookingstar1

Right after I phoned the hotel to confirm they would waive the fee, the hotel rep said because it was within 24 hours they would absolutely reimburse the total amount I had paid, BUT they said it had NOT been canceled. So I phoned Booking.com again and asked why it hadn't been cancelled, she told me that they were waiting on the confirmation email, and said, if they cancel now I would be charged, and they didn't want that to happen. I told her that I had spoken to the hotel and they said that they needed Booking.com to cancel the booking and they would reimburse in full. I said I understood they would charge me, but I was okay with that. At that point she put me on hold....... after about 5 minutes she came back and told me she was having technical issues, and put me back on hold.... then she comes back and tells me that they cannot cancel the reservation because it is an automated system and they need the confirmation email before cancelling, and said they would send another email and call them. So I phoned the hotel again and asked about the email, and the hotel said that what I was told about the confirmation email needed to be able to cancel was untrue, they lied, trying to take me over the 24 hour limit, and after 24 hours its not a guaranteed reimbursement. The hotel rep at this point spoke to her manager to explain the situation, when she returned she asked if I could go on the app and cancel myself, which I did and she reimburse me in full.",1,2,en,Bookingstar1

1471,AandH,unknown,2021-12-07T18:22:03.000Z,Do not use for flight bookings,"I love booking.com for booking hotels as a customer. But I will NEVER use them for booking flights ever again. I booked two sets of flights for the UK. When the UK changed their CoVID rules/regulations I called booking.com to ask about my options for cancellation/flight changes. I was told I would receive an email with my options. I was reassured that no changes would be made until I received emails indicating my options, after which I would have to call back to initiate the change. (Why couldn’t I just know my options/costs associated when I called in the first place?)Several days later, the day before my departing flight I received two emails, one for my second set of flights stating that I could move my flights but would need to contact booking.com to confirm, and another email for my first set of flights stating that my departing flight was non-refundable/non-changeable but that a voucher was submitted in my behalf for my return flight. I immediately contacted booking,com and was met with resistance and told there was nothing they could do until they listened to a recording of my prior conversation to confirm that I hadn't asked for the voucher. Once confirmed, they could reverse the voucher request if my flight was still confirmed and it hadn’t been processed. I was very upset. Because at this point, I am getting ready to leave the next day and now wondering if I have a flight back! Mid conversation the customer service rep hung up on me. (I was definitely airing my frustration). So I sent booking.com an email and also tried to reply to the email that was sent, letting me know a voucher request had been submitted. I didn’t hear anything. Nothing good. Nothing bad. So I set off on my departure flight and all was good. But now, here I am off in the UK getting ready to check-in to my flight home, and there is no flight. I call booking.com and they Confirm a voucher has been issued but can’t give me any information on how to use it. I ask to speak to a supervisor. I am told I should call the airline and see if they can reverse the voucher request and get me back on the same flight. If they can’t, ask them how to use my voucher. I’m just livid. Booking.com should have done this in the first place! So I call the airline and they say that booking.com has my voucher information and there is no record of my flight any longer and that the only way the airline can help me is to help me book a new flight, but not with my e voucher because it has to be issued by booking.com. So yet again. I call booking.com. This was my favorite rep who seemed to understand my frustrations of feeling stranded and yet, I am told I have to wait to be contacted by a supervisor which could be up to 24 hours. BUT MY FLIGHT LEAVES IN 24 HOURS!!! I’ve now found myself rebooking the same exact flight through the airline for 2x the original cost, with a wasted unknown e voucher floating somewhere in space, with still zero news from booking.com and how they will remedy this situation. So so disappointed. Never ever ever would I recommend this platform for flight bookings. The headache and money lost is not worth the idea of a slightly cheaper flight. Also. For my second set of flights… understand that a “flexible booking” option does not mean the same as flexible booking directly with the airline. It’s really just an added cost to make you feel like you have more control when in reality, it allows one flight adjustment (you have to know exactly what flight, day and time you want to move it to), and then at that point, you now have a flight with no flexibility. So. It’s not the same as booking directly with the airline. Consider yourself warned. I would hate for anyone to have this kind of experience.",1,0,en,Bookingstar1

There for a gig at the ajoined O2 Venue that evening. Arrived to check in on the day at around 3:15pm to be informed by Security that the Hotel is closed, there's no way we could have booked a room. We showed him the booking so he let us in to speak to reception, they informed us the Hotel closed at the start of the first UK Lockdown in March 2020 and hasn't been open for guests since. Further to that he asked if we'd booked through booking.com. When we said yes, he explained they'd called him 2 days prior and he'd explicitly informed them the hotel isn't taking bookings and they need to contact/cancel any reservations they've accepted...Thanks to booking.com we ended up stranded without a hotel room in Manchester, 400 yards from Old Trafford just as the final whistle was blown and roughly 70,000 football fans left the stadium. I called their customer service and explained the scenario. After 10 minutes on hold, their best customer service offer? ""Would you like to cancel your booking?"".Not a sorry for putting you in this position, no, can I help find you an alternative...would you like to cancel the booking for a non existent room in a closed hotel...When I confirmed that I indeed wanted to cancel the entirely redundant booking I was then placed on hold again and left there until I had to disconnect to try and find some kind of working alternative myself. Every other venue around the area was full capacity understandably due to travelling football fans. Today my partner received an email, they cancelled the booking but the hotel will charge us a cancellation fee...They've ""oh so kindly"" emailed the hotel to ask them not to charge us. Then said we'll need to follow it up with the hotel though because they haven't responded. They're getting 1 star becuse Trustpilot literally won't let me give 0.I would say this is closer to a clown academy than a competent business, if that wasn't so unfair on clown academies.

So, Booking com quickly dealt with our problem by cancelling our confirmed reservation without consulting with us first, or finding us a suitable villa as an alternative.  At least we had not booked any flights, car hire, etc. Booking com should have called us first and asked whether we had already found a similar villa in Italy (not similar in price, but similar to the 4* quality we had originally booked).

I immediately contacted the hotel and this company informing them of my situation… this company said they’d pass it over to the hotel. The hotel have told me that I am being charged full price for the booking as they are suffering with the Covid situation too.

1507,Allison,unknown,2021-12-02T15:49:58.000Z,Appalling. Avoid at all costs.,"I've used Booking here and there for several years, thinking it was a convenient way to find available rooms in the UK for domestic holidays. After my last experience at the Ben Sheann hotel in Strathyre, I can say that I will never use Booking again, and would actively encourage people to steer clear. I had an appalling evening at a very poor hotel, a ""Preferred Partner"" of Booking whose high ratings and site description seem dishonest at best. In fact, my negative review of this hotel was hidden by Booking, which doesn't seem like a coincidence to me. I requested a refund of one night, as my last night was unacceptable in terms of guest safety (there was a powercut, yet the hotel owner made no accommodation for this: no torch or candles, no extra blankets to beat the cold, no breakfast possible of course due to lack of power in the morning, but the breakfast was included in the price). It seems noncontroversial to request a refund for a night where you are literally not getting what you paid for in any way. You can't use any of the things that cost the hotel owner money! No electricity usage, no heat, nothing. However, the hotel owner ""disagreed"" with my reasons for wanting a refund, and refused. Booking supported the hotel owner, and offered me a voucher worth one-third of the night's stay as compensation. They said they would not do anything further, though I pointed out that the conditions my husband I were left in (the only people in the hotel that night!) were unsafe and unacceptable.I find the whole experience disgraceful. How can you have a Preferred Partner that behaves in this way? This is not a hotel: it's a glorified bothy. No accommodations taken for guest safety in case of emergency is unacceptable. There wasn't even any way of contacting the owner or a staff member. Booking did not acknowledge any of this, and instead said that their hands were tied due to the owner's refusal to refund the single night. As far as I'm concerned, they seem to collude with poor properties to dupe customers. I would not trust any of the ratings they have on their listed properties, since they will hide reviews and not even explain why. You are much better off booking straight with a hotel that has some internet presence and an established reputation. I won't make this mistake again, and I will never use Booking again.",1,0,en,Bookingstar1

At no point did they mention that the card has to be present they emailed me the night before even though I explained another member will check in . They refused us to check in demanding that we cancel the current booking and rebook with the current card holder present .

We'd booked weeks early because we'd saved for it and were going up for a graduation. He hadn't actually cancelled the booking on booking.com, because he thought he'd keep both lots of money.Mario, from booking.com took the live chat. He spoke to the host, who said the boiler was broken. Mario believed that lie, and then said all they could do was cancel the booking for us and refund within 7-10 days. We saved for the booking.

Upon finding that lower price direct with the hotel, I wanted to maintain my booking with booking.com, so I sent them the required documentation (link to the rate, pricing charged, and if meals were included).  First I was told that upon trying to replicate, they couldn't find a room available for my dates. This was incorrect, as I tried multiple other times and was able to easily access this.  Secondly, I was told my provided link ""did not work"".  Upon sending another message with the requested details, I was informed that as the room type on booking.com is categorized as a ""superior king"" and the room type on the hotel's site is classified as a ""king"", they could not price match as the ""superior"" king is different. Upon exploring the options on the hotel's site, they do NOT offer a ""superior"" king and the description of the standard king and photos were all the same (actually the standard king direct even provided additional square footage).  As booking.com did not offer just a ""king"", they could not honor a match.I booked direct with the hotel and cancelled through booking.com. I will never use them again.  The customer service was terrible (they couldn't even spell my name right in responses...), the price was close to $400 additional that they would not honor a match for, and their ""price match"" claims are a complete and total scam.  I feel completely bait & switched, but after reading additional reviews on the company, I am glad I got out when I did instead of the EXCESSIVE things I'm now reading about experiences with trouble during travel.

We arrived at 'the upper house apartment' to be told on the phone that we had to pay £250 to a private bank account as a security deposit. Never once have I been asked to do this at any property before. Where is my protection as a customer that I would receive that back? We refused to do this before we had checked over the property. We got inside, the fire alarm was missing (red flag straight away), there was marks all over the walls, dining table was broken, ready meals left in the fridge past the use by date, window was broken (we were even told by the man showing us around that a gust of wind would open the window) which as you can appreciate in Novemeber & with the snow at the moment it is absolutely freezing so the bedroom was so cold it was impossible to stay in there, then there was the attic hole which wasn't covered over meaning we could see straight out to the roof (again making this freezing) We refused to stay there and the owner was nothing but rude with disgusting attitude. Obviously we had attitude back because when being spoken to like that it gets your back up. We then spoke to booking.com who told us on the phone that the woman should never have asked for this deposit to her personal bank account and that we would get a refunded. This was all told through a recorded phone all. Fast forward an hour we had a representative from booking.com ring with the most appalling attitude who told us we would not get a refund as the owner of the property had denied all knowledge and said that she would give us the funds back. My argument is where do we stand as a consumer, what protection do we physically have when the owner has the last say even though its lies. There is even other reviews on there to advise of the broken window and the other problems yet apparently we are the liars.

1578,Louise Emily,unknown,2021-11-23T15:56:45.000Z,They clearly don’t check their properties before listing them,Used this website because I wanted to book a hotel to avoid the hassle of booking something privately. Booked an apartment for the weekend on here and it was a disaster - the apartment gave me the wrong details and so we ended up stranded outside for hours and having to pay for taxis to go and get the keys from a different location - total wild goose hunt which no one informed of us beforehand despite me calling them a week in advance. We ended up actually missing my 30th dinner we’d booked (the entire point of the weekend away!). Also had to drop the keys back off for check out - again in a weird location far away from the apartment. Booking.com is only suitable if your willing to check your phone and emails constantly on the day and if you don’t mind keys not even being at the property when you arrive. I’ve also not received my £300 deposit back from the apartment and Booking.com said there is nothing they can do as the apartment do not agree to give any compensation - not sure if I will get the deposit back - it’s not looking promising.Despite leaving the apartment nearly spotless and as we found it - I’m now out of pocket due to spending money on 3 separate taxis just to pick up and drop off these keys - a hotel check in shouldn’t be that complicated or time consuming. This was my first time using this website but I’ll definitely stick to the other booking sites from now.,1,0,en,Bookingstar1

I have sent numerous emails to complain and no one has responded. I have asked for their complaints procedure - NOTHING.

The plan was that after dinner and drinks, she would go clubbing with friends and we would see a show.She was due to travel down to us in London from Bournemouth first thing on Saturday when we received a call from a friend to say that she'd become unwell he'd called an ambulance. I called the hotel straight after he'd rang (approximately 9am) to speak with them directly but reception explained I'd need to email their duty manager. In emailing I noted that the hotel was fully booked and felt that they may hopefully have enough time to resell the bookings - check-in wasn't until 3pm. They replied to say that they have a strict policy regarding refunds but that I would be allowed to rebook as long as I made contact within a week.By this time we were at the hospital and learned that our daughter was seriously ill. We stayed by her bedside for almost 24hrs before checking in to a local hotel exhausted to get some sleep. I managed to reply to Z Trafalgar updating them on how grave the situation was, how much stress we were under and that I would submit hospital records to substantiate what I had informed them of already requesting that I be refunded under theses extenuating circumstances.The hotel replied that I had until March '22 to make a booking or could gift the rooms to friends or family.Our daughter is currently a long-term patient in a hospital over 100 miles from where we live we will be travelling this distance regularly to see her. We really don't need the extra stress of re-organising our booking, never mind gifting the rooms. We feel that Z Hotel Trafalgar are displaying an utter lack of compassion in not refunding us.

As the hotel cost was met this condition I took advantage of this offer when booking the hotel. Confirmation of the hotel booking arrived almost immediately as did another email telling me that there was an issue “at their end” with the taxi and asking me to make contact – but without providing any contact details. After a great deal of searching I found a phone number but was told it was the wrong one I needed the Taxi Dept. After being cut off once I managed to get through to a most unhelpful person who claimed that it wasn’t his problem but the booking people. Beginning to feel like a tennis ball being hit back and forward I then tried to use the Chat Line. Again unhelpful and suggested paying for the taxi myself and claiming back the cost. Not the best solution but one I was going to have to accept. Shortly before my departure I was bombarded with emails offering to book a taxi (it would cost me) so I asked Booking.com why it couldn’t now provide me with the original offer. Apart from the auto response nothing. On my return home I sent a copy of the taxi receipt but have heard nothing from Booking.com apart from the usual auto no reply email response.

My first try on Booking.com-I searched for Northampton, MASSACHUSETTS, (USA) on Sept 17 evening. Booking.com gave me Northampton, GREAT BRITAIN! Did not realize they switched to that location (even though the reservation was listed in US dollars), but after confirming...suddenly British Pounds appear and we realized we were scammed by them-for a hotel in ANOTHER country! I called them to cancel with Hilton and Booking.com in Great Britain, but was given the run around and 'pass the buck on the poor sucker' game by both of them. Realized we needed a place in the US overnight, so I asked Booking.com to find and reserve a hotel in Massachusetts. Feeling burned by them already, I was glad they recorded their calls, because I did not trust them, so I said over 4 times to the booking agent ""This hotel MUST be in Massachusetts, so is it in Massachusetts?"" Was assured each time that it was. After booking it, found out it was in ANOTHER STATE. I called them back and they said no refunds, I said ""listen to your recorded conversation with me and refund my money-it's your mistake, not mine."" They finally agreed to do that and then told me ""Yes, you said Massachusetts over 4 or 5 times-we will refund you."" Then had them book a hotel nearby us, we go to it and...we have no reservation there! I asked for a refund and another hotel with Booking.com in nearby Chicopee at a Residence Inn...and we get there...NO RESERVATION there either.! So now I hate Booking.com for their complete scammy incompetence, lies, and theft of my money. So-I got charged for the Great Britain hotel they fraudulently redirected me to, the one without the reservation Booking.com said I had in Springfield, Mass, and when we showed up at the Chicopee hotel Booking.com reserved-we were told they had no rooms available! It's 1am the next day by now and I was ready to have a meltdown-but the nice manager took pity on us weary travelers and gave us a room that was out of commission for weeks and was unavailable on all their sites and inside the hotel to people (while they tried to rid it of a former long-stay smoker stink). My husband stopped smoking 26 years ago, but smoke triggers his urge still. He was willing to stay there just to get some rest-so we could drive straight home the next day. (Booking.com ruined our trip enough that we cut it short). I notified them that they said they would refund the bill for the 2nd hotel, but Booking.com screwed that up, too. We got charged for that hotel and when I called the hotel to send me proof that we never stayed there-Kurt, from that same Hilton Hotel front desk (in Springfield, Mass) said they had no record before, during or after the date I was charged for. He said we didn't stay there. This is not only a bad company with bad policies, misadvertisement & misdirection to cheat you, but they are also incapable of accepting accountability (the cowardly, cheap, smarmy, rip-off artists). If you got cheated by them-file a complaint with your BBB, your Attorney General, tell ALL your friends & acquaintances to avoid Booking.com and try another site-or better yet, book it directly with actual the hotel.

I have ordered a hotel in Dubai. I have booked so I would pay at the hotel when checking in. Just before entering the airport, I got an SMS from booking.com, that I should update my credit card, otherwise I could loose my booking. I did it right away! Got the same SMS 30 minutes later. This time I tried to upload another credit card. Also seemed a bit weird that I should do this since no payment before entering the hotel, but didn't want to take any chances. I quickly called the hotel to check if everything was OK. They told me that there was no problem, and everything was fine. 1,5 HOUR AFTER I got an message saying the hotel has cancelled our reservation! Well, not stressfull at all, conserdering this was 5 minutes before my boarding, where I would strand in Dubai at midnight!!!!!! Quickly called booking.com, they promised to get back to me by e-mail, THEY NEVER DID. I also called hotel to see if I could book directly through them, but they told me that they were fully booked (but funny enough there was plenty of rooms on both booking.com and their website) I am very unsatisfied with ""Revier Dubai"" and also Booking.com.

It said that Booking.com would pay the difference, about 15% (compared to the price requested by the property). Until a few hours before, it was all taken, but I do suppose, a cancelation suddenly came. I booked, BUT I also could smell rotten, knowing Booking.com so, after the payment I went back to the site and (obviously) the offer was gone as it was the last one.I was only able to view my payment history on my bank account two days later 'cause the Bank only shows it two days later. The cost was full charged ! So by the time I could see the charge it was too late.In response to my complaint, customer service asked for the screen shot as proof.Does anyone think it is normal to take a sreen-shot before making a reservation?  I don't think it is!Well, B.com doesn't want to go back to their bidding history... so I had an overcharged debit due to Booking.com's inefficiency and dishonesty. AVOID IT ! SOMETIME THEY'RE UNTRUSTABLE !Go to the Hotel Site and eventually ask a discount instead to book through B.com",1,1,en,Bookingstar1

My complaint is, essentially, that booking.com has sought my 'opinion' about a hotel I stayed in. My review raised entirely demonstrable concerns both about the appalling quality of the hotel as well as about the booking.com decision to grade it as 'good' when other organisations graded it much worse and provided full details from customers about even worse experiences than mine, including theft of money and property by cleaning staff! The wiliness slipped over into frank dishonesty when I was sent a no-doubt automated decision my submitted, very critical review, was now live and I was invited to view it. Of course, the hyper-link took to me to a 'sales pitch' for this same hotel which, interestingly only featured ridiculously and unconvincingly positive reviews but none which were critical. When I eventually found mine buried deeply in the hotel reviews they published (you might have expected them to feature it first as the most recent .... mmm, I wonder why?!) my grading rating of 1 star was noted but all the details were 'hidden' because it 'failed to meet their standards' ... standards about what, I wonder?! Clearly this is a company which goes out of its ways to project all its compliant accommodation providers positively and only publishes reviews which enhance that projection. Clearly honesty, transparency and accuracy take a very back seat to shamelessly collusive commercial interests. Shame on them. I will certainly never believe a word about any reviews they publish now and, where possible, I will avoid ever making a booking with them for their flagrant dishonesty and lack of concern for customers.",1,1,en,Bookingstar1

After contacting them to request a full refund for my stay at the Calypso Hotel in Albert Road Blackpool they did not put any pressure whatsoever on this filthy hotel to give me a full refund. I arrived at the hotel on Friday night and the room I was given seemed ok but I got a rude awakening when I was woken up on Saturday morning to the horrible smell of cooking. My room was full of fumes and absolutely stinking, I later realised that the room was above the kitchen which obviously did not have an extraction fan or the one they had was not working. To add to this the wardrobe door if you can actually call it a wardrobe could not close. The result being that my clothes were saturated with this smell. I approached the manager who said that as I stayed on Friday night he would only refund me for Saturday, this was even after I explained that if I knew what was to come I would never have stayed even on the Friday. I also discovered that the shower was absolutely filthy with mould growing underneath the handle and there was signs of legionella on the walls. I contacted booking.com to try to get a full refund but most importantly to warn that this hotel was actually dangerous and that it would only take a child to scrape their fingers on the wall and put them in their mouth to cause a catastrophe. Booking.com’s excuse was that they book so many hotels that they can’t check them all. They also told me that I should get in contact with the hotel manager to request the rest of the refund.

Hotel Largo BeachPromenade Street8240Slanchev Bryag,Sunny Beach,BulgariaTel: +359 89 900 0760At NO point in our communication did anyone tell us that the hotel season ended on 26th September and that the services/facilities would be closed.Instead, I was asked to pay for the shuttle bus in advance and the card details were provided directly via my WhatsApp account.First of all, my 72 years-old mother arrived at a building with about 100 rooms on three floors, all completely empty, with the exception of her own room. There was NO kitchen, NO canteen, NO reception desk, NO security and there were NO other guests – in the whole building. My mother’s room was on the third floor and food was delivered to her on a tray by a hotel cleaner. There was no option of going somewhere to choose what she wanted to eat, it was simply a case of the only thing that was available was delivered to her. My mother was so frightened to stay in that hotel that she hardly slept. When she spoke to some people by the seaside, she was told that the holiday season had ended on 26th September and people were surprised that nobody had told her this, and that she had been offered a hotel stay with full service included.In the morning she was offered a sandwich without any drinks, and in the evening, it was BBQ chicken but without any seasoning or vegetables or side dishes. As I mentioned, it was delivered to her room by the cleaner and she was not asked whether she liked it, she was just given the food.Please note that I had ordered half-board and had been asked to pay for it.My mother was transferred to another hotel on 30th September as I stated above. Complex Antantic - Plamen Todorov - Bulgaria, Ravda, Apostol Voivoda 12 Now I understand the reason why, as you probably can understand, a 72 years old lady in a foreign country staying at an empty 100-bedroom hotel - all by herself. I would be not be able to sleep at all. That is exactly how my mother told me she felt while she was staying at the Hotel Largo Beach.She was transferred to a facility owned by a close friend of the hotel owner, far from the beach, and was apparently moved there because the parents of the owner were able to feed my mother with the food, they were cooking for themselves.Again, no choice of food was given in this instance but at least it was better cooked as it was prepared by the owner’s parents.As my mother was not shown where the beach was from the day she moved to this property (30th September) until 3rd October she mainly stayed indoors and occupied her time by sweeping the territory to keep it clean and to my surprise nobody stopped her from doing this.  I was paying for her to have a holiday, not to clean somebody else’s property!The owner even offered my mother to come back next year for a whole season and sweep his property for 50 leva a week!Only on 3rd October was my mother shown the way to the beach, and finally on the 5th October she safely flew back home.I am astonished by the whole fiasco, I thought I knew what to expect from a half-board beach holiday, having experienced several such holidays in the past. Please note both names - Complex Atlantic and Hotel Largo Beach  - and i am still fighting for my refund with the booking.com who are totally ignoring me and my problem with this bookingNever again will book any trips to Bulgaria.",1,1,en,Bookingstar1

I feel sorry for the call handlers because it's the management of booking.com being too cowardly to deal with what they themselves called a ""serious incident"" hiding behind the poor souls who are apparently dealing with 1000s of similar calls.Hollow apologies, no contact, you have to do all the work for them and ultimately they were happy for a pregnant woman to have nowhere to rest or sleep.Honestly do not know what to do other than take them to court at this point.Would never use them again.

Fortunately, despite the hotel at that point not knowing if the fault was theirs or booking.com, the hotel put us into an alternative hotel for the night so they could then sort out the following day.

They couldn't find a record of the initial payment so refused to (or wouldn't / couldn't) cancel the scheduled payment.We contacted booking.com again the day after (after the second charge had been taken) to advise them of the duplicate payment and that we had been charged a total of £300 for a £125 room (£175.10 + £125.10, the original payment included £50 advance payment for 'incidentals'). They said they'd look into it.We contacted them a couple of days later to essentially get an update and to advise them that if we didn't get the £175.10 refunded we would be in very real danger of running out of money on holiday. They still weren't aware of the duplicate payments.On the day of our hotel stay (15th Oct) we were telephoned and told that the duplicate payment would be refunded within 24hrs. It wasn't.To cut a long story short, despite wasting around an hour a day each day of our holiday, using what little internet access we had we didn't get the refund until  21st Oct, four full days into a seven day holiday... fours days in which our daily budget was €20.00 rather than the €50.00 it would have been if we'd not been double charged... four days in which we had to resort to eating sandwiches in supermarkets rather than meals in restaurants... four days in which we had to drink water rather than beer / cocktails... four days in which we enviously watched others going on day trips or doing activities rather than going on day trips or doing activities ourselves... four days in which our expensive holiday was 'ruined'. Of course in reality we didn't 'have to' do anything of these things but if we'd spent money as we wanted to we'd have run out half way through the holiday and ended up in a foreign country surviving on hotel breakfast alone.In complaining after the event we have been told that there is nothing that booking.com can do other than offer an apology as we were 'not obligated' to make the proactive payment and booking.com hadn't done anything wrong... it seems that as we were not obligated to make that payment booking.com were not obligated to resolve the issue in a timely manner, rather it was perfectly acceptable for them to refund us nine days after we first raised the issue.A very disappointing and costly experience (in terms of our holiday enjoyment) with nothing other than a 'sorry' by way of response from Booking.com.",1,2,en,Bookingstar1

When I replied that a complementary continental breakfast was mentioned on the web site, he started screaming “Show me. Show me or you don’t stay!” and then  “You’re calling me a liar!” I was shocked. At this point, I decided we did NOT want to stay there whether there was coffee or not. I explained that I had never called him a liar but he was still very upset. He agreed to refund my non-refundable payment and yelled “and you never stay here again!” I laid down the keys, and walked out, telling him I’d look for a receipt online.He followed me outside, got in my face, and said “Just touch me”. I didn’t understand at first. He got closer and said “Just touch me"" twice more. I realized then that he was looking for an excuse to punch me! I’m 70 years old, he was half my age, and I’ve never settled disagreements with my fists. I backed away, got in the car with my terrified wife, who saw the last psycho part, and drove away. By the way, checking later, the GG Tibet Inn's own web site DOES advertize Complimentary continental breakfast (in high season).

1725,Tanya,unknown,2021-11-04T14:01:56.000Z,Third-party booking sites: a lawsuit waiting to happen,"The fact that Booking.com hasn't even bothered to give any of these complaints a one-line copy-and-paste reply, really does tell you everything you need to know about Booking.com - they couldn't care less and are ultimately there to profit off you and the hotel, whilst not providing any service themselves.Booking.com can be handy - until something goes wrong. For years I used Booking.com as somehow they get hotels to match their cheapest rate, even though they are charging them a commission on your booking. Eventually, I figured out that hotels must only agree to this for the customer exposure, but ultimately it drives up room rates as hotels will have to charge more to cover the commission cost, meaning that by using these sites, the consumer is missing out. We are footing the bill for the commission paid to Booking.com ourselves.Furthermore, I got hit by a terrible case of the hotel that I booked (that cost £1200) grossly misrepresenting itself. In UK law, it is illegal to misrepresent yourself as a business. Booking.com's response (after an extremely painful conversation with someone who could barely understand me) was that it says on their T&Cs that they are not liable for any misrepresentation by the hotel.My husband then went to his credit card issuer, to claim through them, but as Booking.com is the third party, and the credit card issuer can only recover costs when a hotel booking is made directly with a hotel, he was unable to claim for the cost of the hotel, purely because he used a third-party booking website, even though they deemed the case to be worthy of a refund.This means that if you use third party sites like Booking.com, you are paying to support an industry that drives up the price of hotel rooms, whilst also handing over any legal rights that you have through your credit card issuer, to a company that will close the door on you as soon as they have taken your money.It is only a matter of time before someone sues one of these third-party hotel booking websites for writing in their T&Cs that they are 'not liable for any misrepresentation by the hotel', which would be deemed an unfair term and be thrown out by any court, also resulting in these vultures receiving heavy fines - someone just needs to bring the court case and set the precedent so that these online booking websites can no longer get away with their dirty business practice.",1,0,en,Bookingstar1

I had informed booking.com when it happened. They did nothing to support me and my experience. I had no-where to stay that day as the accommodation refused my check-in, and had to immediately find another hotel that was available. I had requested a refund from the accommodation and booking.com, as I did not even end up staying at the accommodation. But neither the accommodation provided a refund and neither booking.com. Therefore, I consider that booking.com and the accommodation have in fact kept the money for themselves, without providing a refund. At one stage, the provider promised a 40% refund, which was not honoured until today. Therefore they have lied, and bookings.com has supported this lie. Both bookings.com and the accomodation provider have taken my money, and have not provided the service of accomodation. Please be careful when you book with bookings.com. If it is not an official hotel, be careful with other accommodation providers on their site. You could have no accomodation and be left stranded. Bookings.com also defends their accommodation providers even when they are wrong and incorrect in their behaviour, just like this case I experienced.",1,0,en,Bookingstar1

I looked online and this is a common practice with Booking.com  I will not use them anymore after I complete the stays I already booked as it is impossible to get help or compensation in this type of situation.  I simply booked a different more expensive place as there is a big even and nothing affordable is available last minute.  If I were still young and without resources it would have meant sleeping in the airport or a park.  Not an ethical company.  Booking directly with a hotel or with VRBO is better.  AirBnB also has better service, but they have privacy issues.Booking.com refuses to allow reviews when the property cancels so it is impossible to know how frequently they do this, it could be the classic bait and switch scam.",1,1,en,Bookingstar1

When I got to the property around midnight, the staff told me ""there's no availability anymore, you have to contact whoever you book the room with"", and went back into the room.I called booking.com, and it took them an hour to find me another hotel about 20min away. When I got to the new hotel, it was already 2:00am.It was such a terrible experience when you found yourself in a new city you are not familiar with, don't know anyone in the city, midnight, exhausted, and with nowhere to go. At one point around 1:00am, I thought I would be homeless for the night. So think twice before you book hotel with booking.com, and book this hotel.They still charged me for the night's stay. When I contacted the hotel customer service, they told me I have to contact booking.com. When I contacted booking.com, they said because I was charged by the hotel directly, so they need to contact the hotel.

Worse still, we were offered no compensation or even a small goodwill gesture when a mistake made by reception staff meant another couple were given our room key and walked in on me in the shower, then got nasty as they thought I was in ‘their’ room. The hotel point blank refused any sort of resolution but promised the manager would call me the next day to discuss my complaint. He didn’t, and when I phoned to chase, the phone was slammed down as soon as I said why I was calling. I assumed booking.com would want to be aware of the incident with the other guests,  the fact that their webpages for the hotel are completely misleading and the fact that the hotel has such a poor approach to resolving complaints. I emailed them and received two emails within the next few days saying that booking.com customer services believed I should be given a full refund by the hotel and they would pursue this for me. Sounded good. Five weeks then went by with no update. After chasing twice more, I received an email from booking.com last week saying they can’t contact the hotel (?!) so I can’t have a refund but could have the ‘maximum available compensation’ of £21 in cash. I replied to say I rejected this offer and still wanted a full refund. Booking.com then issued 21 EUROS to my account (£17) as a credit to be used against a future stay - so not even the £21 cash originally promised! Further communication has resulted in a series of automated responses telling me to contact the hotel with my complaint - so right back to square one.I’ve booked dozens of times with booking.com in the last few years assuming I would always be protected by them if something went wrong with one of their properties, but how wrong I was.

Paid 321.00 for a flex ticket to only be told when I needed to change my flight due to covid that it would cost me additional money. Then I asked if I could add a flight so someone could go with me on that later date and was told that I would need to purchase that online. I asked if my account could be notated so that I could go online and purchase additional ticket to make sure we could be on same flight and I’d call back if we could and was told “no”. Customer service rep was from another country and he and I both had hard times understanding one another so when I asked to speak to someone else he said I would have to call back. Now this is after earlier in the day I spoke to 2 people and after 45 mins and the second representative was told to call back due to technical difficulties. Due to aggravation I then asked to speak to supervisor and was told “no”. He stated that no one was available. I asked how he would know as he didn’t check and he stated that “no” he would first need to know why I needed a supervisor so I then stated why and he then said “no” again. Worst customer service I have ever received anywhere and I have used booking before and after this experience will not be using it again.,1,0,en,Bookingstar1

This due to covid didn't happen.  18 months later a trip was planned for this weekend (23/10/21)  I booked our hotel through booking.com months in advance.  Very often I have used them, I have even helped booked trips for family.  Just after 11pm on 20/10/21 I received an email (if I didn't have my notifications on I would not have received it until the morning as I was half asleep) from booking.com stating my booking had been cancelled as they could not take payment from my card.  I was distraught.  I tried phoning the hotel that night who advised me I had to pick it up with booking.com.  The next morning I got through, I thought great I will get it booked again.  Long story short I was told my original pay method had been declined that's why I had my booking cancelled.  I said I changed my card details at the beginning of the week in anticipation of payment going out as I did not want to use the card I used months ago to book.  I was told the ""system"" several times would pick up the original card and that it had to be a credit card and not a debit card.  I argued the point that I should not have been able to change the details in that case, I even had an email confirming I had successfully updated my card details. I also argued it was nonsense not to be able to use a debit card.  The representative said once a booking had been cancelled they could no longer reinstate it and that the hotel was now fully booked. I stated it was not my fault they used the wrong card, however I didn't get anywhere and incidentally lost my booking.  All hotels appear fully booked or triple in price.

YES, it was listed as an example and even had a price attached to it!Rest assured I put my son’s name and mine on the flight tickets as I wasn’t sure if my partner could come.

The 24 hours “window” for making the change of name on flight ticket was coming to an end so I had no choice but to call again EasyJet and agreed to pay fully the £60 fee and the call handling! I must mention that easyJet’s phone number charges are also high!   @ £6 flat fee for each phone call and that is on top of your own mobile service provider or land line might be charging!I’ve contacted again today (Wednesday 20/10/2021) Booking.com and explained that even though I’ve paid them for the Flexibility & Protection their customer service did not guide me on how best to approach the change of names instead they said that because I will fly with a low cost carrier the flexibility and protection doesn’t apply.

We were going on an extensive UK tour finishing in Hull and I had to find space for 12 of us, all in separate beds, but in the same hotel or B'n'B. So I booked a place well in advance on the 18th of June, with us due to arrive on the 28th of September. I want to mention that already at this stage it was extremely difficult to find anywhere that fit our requirements more so then in any of the other places we travelled to which included Bristol, Brighton, Dorset, Oxford & Liverpool.A couple of days before we were meant to arrive in Hull the booking gets canceled due to unforeseen circumstances, they tell me nothing more, so I assumed it was a case of over booking... I read the email only two days before arrival as I was extremely busy with the tour and thought it was just a reminder of our booking. Once I realised it was an out right cancellation I started immediately trying to book alternative places, as the place booking.com suggest had no longer space for all of us, as well as they didn't have separate beds, which is our main requirement: we needed separate beds, but could share rooms. At this stage I ccould literally not find anywhere for us to stay, Premier In was booked up, Holiday had no space for all of us either. So I realised we won't be able to stay all together, unless we stayed miles out of Hull in the country side, which wasn't possible as we didn't all have cars and we needed to be able to walk back to our accommodation at 11pm after doing our performances. I called the hotel back that booking.com recommended, they said they didn't have space, but had some space in their two sister hotels. I went for it and had to book one extra room in a the Holiday In to fit us all, as well as buy blow up mattresses to put in the hotel rooms to fit more people in, which the hotel kindly agrees to.The new bill was way above the original £664,70 I paid. So I ask booking.com to reimburse me for the additional costs incurred. Seeing as I not only spent lots more money, but also had to spend an incredible stressful day booking this while I was meant to do other work, as well as that we wouldn't be able to stay all together which was highly inconvenient for us and made some of us feel very unsafe!Booking.com refused this and when I said I wouldn't accept this they just kept sending me the same response instead of referring me to a manager or someone in higher authority as I asked for.Their reason for refusing is that the new places found were a lot more expensive and not the one they suggested. As explained above, the hotel suggested by them didn't have enough space for us, nor did it meet our requirments.

1847,Ron Grabner,unknown,2021-10-19T14:04:42.000Z,I booked a Taxi from Valencia airport…,"I booked a Taxi from Valencia airport to my hotel. In the space provided for comments, I stated that I would be transporting a bike box and gave the measurements, and asked that I be provided with a vehicle with the boot/trunk space for it to fit in. When the Taxi arrived it was immediately apparent that it was not big enough. However, with my help, we squeezed the bike box on to the back seat, leaving about 4"" at best for my wife and I to sit. However on the return journey, though the driver acknowledged that he had seen the note about the bike box, it did not fit into his boot, and he refused to take us. Fortunately there was a Taxi rank nearby, and we hired another Taxi with a bigger boot. I contacted Booking.com on my return to explain what had happened, not looking for compensation, just a refund for the Taxi which refused to take us. I was quoted lines from their terms and conditions, which, according to Booking.com meant it was my fault for booking the wrong size Taxi. I reiterated the fact that I had told them about the oversized luggage and that I would have expected someone to recommend the appropriate vehicle, but they were just not interested, and just kept passing the buck. One email said I should have informed them in writing. I was under the impression that an email was writing!! I've been a loyal customer for many years (apparently a genius!!) which also entitles me to 10% discount on Taxi fares. What a con!! The replacement (larger) Taxi I had to hire was exactly the same price as the one I had prepaid, and would have actually been marginally cheaper had we not been held up in traffic due to an accident.

(They claim that the booking details that they received from Booking.com was missing the cvc code so they couldn't take the payment) Booking.com's advice to avoid a similar situation in the future is contacting the hotels to check if everything is OK every time we make a booking through Booking.com!

Looks like if you pre-paid for something you don´t see good luck then to get you money back if you don´t like the place when you phisically see the place. It is ridiculous.Nowadays anybody can just post a domestic accomodation to advertise it in booking website as luxurious place and  worst of all is that it seems that booking doesn´t actually care as long as they make money for it.

But not for Booking.com who attempt to put you under soo much pressure that you feel forced to cancel your booking. The approach from customer service was very unpleasant with agents that just had 1 goal to get you to cancel the booking. They repeat the same thing, do not know the facts and refused to listen to the customer. I asked to speak to a manager which they couldn't do for this issue. Last agent I spoke to refused to end the conversation until I had confirmed to cancel the booking, eventually the line went dead.Booking dot com has passed it's use by date and will probably drown in its own misery.

I booked a hotel room in Manchester called Central Suites through booking.com assuming that everything will be fine as booking.com is a worldwide company and checks the properties that are listed through the site. Once I booked the hotel I made my way to the address that was in booking.com , when I arrived to that address (9 Sudenhil Rd) I could only see a jewelry shop and no hotel to be found. I then called the number of the hotel ( a mobile and not a landline) and they were asking me for 200 pounds deposit so they can give me the correct postcode. As you can understand I took this as another red flag and I felt unsafe to go through with the money transfer ( by the way they wanted the money in cash or transfer to a personal account) I also felt unsafe to stay there whatsoever so I decided to cancel thee booking 15 mins after I made it. I called the hotel and they referred me to. Booking.com as I made the reservation through them. I called booking.com and I spoke with a staff member that's she agreed that everything feels dodgy and she understood my side so she would ask her supervisors to help. After she spoke with the supervisors though she came back and said that basically they do business with the hotel for 2 years now and they taking the hotel's side. I then explained to the staff member again that they advertise a hotel that has no legit website, no legit address or phone number and the owner asks for 200 pounds cash so he can give the right address, and after I snooped in the reviews I saw that more people had the same problem. It was then that I asked to speak with her supervisors directly and when she asked them to speak with me they REFUSED to speak with me , something that is actually sad and embarrassing for them and shows exactly what kind of company they are. Even if they wouldn't want to take any action it's common courtesy to speak with a customer that is in distress and has issues of potential fraud from a hotel that you as booking.com advertise.

Then of course, the refund (a miserable 10%) will take up to 15 business days.4 bloody months to get my money back for the horrible service they provided.

1935,911hooner,unknown,2021-10-10T22:23:10.000Z,"Dreadful customer service, manipulated reviews","I have used booking.com multiple times over the last five years. I have not previously had any particular issues until this year.I went to Canada in late 2021. Travelling solo on the road for all of my trip I relied on them heavily for places to stay along the route and my rental car booking.First issue was with my car booking. Right up until the point of departure it did not show as confirmed . Despite contacting customer service via their chatbot I received no replies over a seven day period and eventually had to track down a number to call them. The agent I spoke to was very good and assured me the car was confirmed despite what the site was saying. So first issue resolved but at my time and expense.The first motel was OK the second was poor but not totally awful The third one made Fawlty Towers ( if you know the comedy show) look like the Waldorf Astoria.The Frontier Motel in Revelstoke should simply not be listed on a site that uses the no holds barred legend of The best hotels at the best price. This place was nothing of the sort There was as far as I can gather somebody actually living in the room I was given. That aside it was frankly disgusting-  and at short notice at 7pm at night I was left to find alternative accommodation that left a big hole in my budget.Ok these things happen what disappoints me is the lacklustre response to my customer service complaint at Booking .com who said sorry - have thirty five Canadian dollars on credit for your next booking- this is about £20, despite me having to pay £120 for alternative accommodation.In my complaint I suggested this motel should not be on their site. I pointed out that the restaurant listed with the motel is actually closed downI checked back today and the advert on their site ( The Best hotels at the Best price) still shows the restaurant.If you check the reviews you get some very short ones saying how this is good for the money, here's a TIP, change the reviews box and see the pages of 1star reviews for this place stating that it is ""stinky"" ""dirty"" ""rundown"" ""decrepit"" "" etc - see the reviews of people who left without staying or the guy who found a dirty needle in the bathroom, the girl who found debris pushed under the bed and so on. These reviews run to pages They also go back over a year saying the restaurant is closed.So Booking.com - The best hotels at the best price- are quite happy to misrepresent this property.This is also apparent when you do their feedback. They, - just like political survey people, angle the questions so there is always a positive to put forward whilst ignoring the negatives Put down a series of negatives and you keep getting ""bonus"" questions - a desperate. cynical attempt to find a positive to spin on their ratings. Ie my favourite, was the location good- yes the location might be good but what was the hotel like!! I took pictures of the room and posted them on the feedback They have yet to appear on the webpage.Meanwhile I am still waiting for an update from Booking.com customer service regarding my last message to them. So I will ask them something on here and see if they respond.Why are you misrepresenting this property on your website? In short throughout my trip most of the motels ranged from acceptable to very good, this one was horrendous. The response from customer service to the concerns has been lacklustre and ineffectual.Booking .com are not interested unless you're booking...and ticking all the right boxes on their feedback requests",1,0,en,Bookingstar1

Had a long weekend booked (Fri to Sun) in Sep with friends for two apartments in Manchester since March 2021. However, the accommodation was cancelled at 8:30 am on the day of check-in citing the cancellation was due to maintenance. However as I was busy organising everything before the trip (kids, work, house and etc) and getting to Euston in time for the train to Manchester, I actually did not receive the message until 10 minutes before the train arrived at Manchester Piccadilly around 3:45 pm. As you can imagine, the next 2 hours was very stressful as we camped out in a pub by the train station to try and find alternative accommodation. Since it was freshers weekend back at University and people wanting to travel again for long weekends after COVID, options were limited and accommodations on Bookings.com and AirB&B were either of significant lower quality for the same price, too far out of Manchester City Center or over double  and in some cases £1000 more for the equivalent accommodation. In the end we had to choose Saschas Hotel which was awful (just check the 6.5k feedback on Booking.com website). The queue to check in was outside the hotel lobby at one point, the breakfast in the morning was at a totally different hotel. Our weekend was totally ruined by this and I just don’t believe the maintenance for the original property is not planned in advanced rather than on the morning of our stay at 8:30 am. Due to the late notice, you would have thought that Booking.com would have had the decency to call me directly to try and resolve the situation rather than by direct inbox message on my Booking.com account. The final slap in the face was receiving an email from customer service on the Monday to apologise after the event. It said “We’re sorry to hear that Dream Apartments Manchester wasn’t able to honour your reservation. We’ve tried contacting you to discuss alternative options, but we were unable to reach you.We hope you've found an alternative accommodation without too much trouble. If you've paid any extra costs, please send us your receipts and we’ll do our best to assist you. We may need to share them with the accommodation in order to confirm your claim.First of all, they did not try to contact me at all – that was a lie! Also, they cancelled on me and if I had done it to them, I would have still been charged but Booking.com gets to ruin my weekend away with friends without any compensation? On top of it, if I paid an extra £1000 for the equivalent property, they would do their best to assist but what if it was refused then I would be £1000 out of pocket as well as having my weekend ruined!

Their managers don’t want to take responsibility and talk to you. Our experience: a member of our travel group telephoned to move our booking dates by one day following our flights being changed. At the same time, without our permission,  they altered our booking terms and conditions from flexible cancellation to no cancellation and without the bank account holders permission just took full payment from their bank account. The payment was not due for another 7 months. Booking.com have admitted their error, but so far are refusing to reimburse us and to revert our booking terms and conditions to those we agreed to.

This happened after finding out the room is not suitable to stay in. There were several good reasons for that. Ultimately, I lost a good sum of money because I reserved the room for several days. The company went with the home owner because, according to booking.com, they can't force him to return the money. Booking.com should not allow this kind of scam to happen, and it should allow their customers to cancel their reserved rooms before they stay in them. One can argue that booking.com allows this kind of scam to happen and Booking.com can fix this kind of thing and they simply don't.Additionally, booking.com stated that cancellation, at one of the steps that I took, was free but the cancellation charge was over 80% of the credit card charge.

At that time they listed full alarm system. We had all our laptops with us and valuables as we left the next day to Johannesburg. That night we woke up and in intruder was next to our bed. I screamed and was terrified and was feeling vulnerable as we were not fully dressed. My partner's quick thinking chased the intruder out the door and he left his laptop bag and left. However we realised that he stole my expensive Apple laptop. We could not get hold of the host as she did not tell us where to find her in this big guesthouse. We were so traumatised and we ran out the door to try and see if we can find the intruder. We later drove to the police station at 3 in the morning. The police sent out a task force to find the guy but could not get hold of him. The Gordonsbay police told me later that they might know who the intruder was as he targets that specific area in Gordonsbay. The host did not care. We basically paid for a nightmare night and did not even sleep much. She just manipulated a story that her insurance cannot pay for my losses. While we were eating breakfast she was in our room to check if we were telling the truth. Later on she admitted that here was footsteps up the wall where the intruder climbed up.  Now I had not luck with her and started to contact customer service at booking.com.. It was all a PR stunt. The one after the other consultant would mail me with false sympathy but nothing came of it. The one consultant even told me that he will talk to management as this is serious. They do not want to admit that it was false advertising on their site and that the guesthouse also lied about the full alarm system that was not even activated or there was no alarm system. Then they delayed me by asking me for a police report and photos. I send them all the info for them to ignore me and say I must talk to the guest house. I had no way to contact the guesthouse as they told me she just denied all my allegations and said it was not true.  So I suffered great loss and booking.com might have told the guest house to adjust her alarm system notes on their website. But I have proof and screenshots of them advertising safety and alarm system.  The host also lied to them and said she has been more than accommodating. It was the worse night of our life and no one cares... I am still traumatised and wake up at night in cold sweat. Worse is she  and booking.com made a money out of our losses. I feel helpless and cheated. As everyone just moved on and I suffered great business losses and are traumatised till this day.  The last feedback I received from Booking.com customer service was contact the guesthouse yourself.

At the time I was not paying that much attention to the pick-up time, but - as requested - I entered the flight number KL1725, which I was thinking was very important information as flights are cancelled and rescheduled, and the car rentals at the airport would then know exactly to be ready for the customer, if following the information about the arriving flights. Well, that was what I thought. However, it turned out that the rental was already closed when I arrived in the afternoon on Sunday, September 26, and the next morning there were no more cars available. Not such big deal - or so I thought - as Sixt rental never got any money, and I got a car from another rental. (Surely I tried to contact Booking.com and the rental Sixt already after I could not get a car, but all Sixt offices were closed and Booking.com has terribly bad Customer Service, which is difficult to be found. E.g. the phone number provided in the voucher does not work.)But now it seems to be very difficult to get my 2008.83 € back from Booking.com. I have been asked to wait until the intended return date of the car, which is October 23. Then I could send a claim. Processing of the claim takes 28 days, and the result cannot be promised by the Customer Service of Booking.com. That means I need to lend my money to them for nothing - not even promise to get my money back - at least for two months.I made a mistake not being punctual when entering the pick-up time, but it doesn't give right to Booking.com to hold my money as they didn't have to pay anything to the Rental.The whole concept of easy booking of cars, flights or hotels through one web-based agent is not feasible for me after this experience. I wonder, if it is legal to keep the payment for services never provided - even only temporarily (which I don't know). Of course it seems to be the standard that Booking.com people don't say they are sorry, but refer to the agreement, which I have approved, when I made the booking.I recommend to everyone from now on to use a real travel agent or book by yourself directly.

We looked and could find nothing similar and therefore waited for booking.com to call back! they did not!!! we were in an unfamiliar country absolutely shattered and were receiving no help. We found a hotel with 3 rooms, which let me assure you is not what we wanted as it would separate us, but we had no choice. We booked and travelled there arriving about 7pm. I asked for a copy of the invoices and forwarded them to booking.com for refund of the difference. I was told because I did not give them enough time to allow them to find alternative accommodation  they would not refund it all, it left us £300 out of pocket. I asked them what would have been a sufficient amount of time and especially with no contact or follow up from them and we got no answer. I have no faith they even looked and left it all to us.

2039,Consumer,unknown,2021-09-29T07:52:46.000Z,Arrived in Morocco with confirmed booking & hotel was closed. Customer relations and resolution lacking at booking.com,"I recently booked a trip to Morocco and had an arrival time of 9pm at hotel booked through booking.com. On arrival, the hotel was closed, even with my booking being confirmed on booking.com.As I was travelling alone and my mobile was not connecting to a local network, I was stranded with no phone to make a call / get help in the late evening in Marrakech. Thankfully, nice locals came to help me after a while and directed me to another two hotels (one over budget & the second just over the price of original booking). I was able to connect to wifi once checked in and contacted booking.com.The customer service agent I originally spoke to was lovely and apologies were given (hotel had not made them aware they were closed) & she advised I would be compensated for the inconvenience, which is my mind, made the situation better. This chat is saved on my booking.com application.The next day I spoke to another agent at booking.com who said I needed to submit invoices for the current hotel, so they could contact the original hotel to try to refund the difference.Such a joke… the least I was expecting from a reputable company was a token of goodwill for the situation I was left in on arrival & at the start of my holiday (as per my original conversation with them), not the exact difference of the booking cost! They fail to remember that the hotel was booked for certain reasons - the central location and more importantly, a swimming pool. Due to having to find somewhere else last minute (will not complain about the place I stayed in, it was clean & was such a relief to have accommodation… but it would not have been my choice for first two days of holidays). I still had a central location but no swimming pool. I worked in hospitality for years and this is not what I was expecting customer service wise. They fail to remember that they are the booking agent, people put faith in them when making the booking, and the bookings are made with them.Used alpha rooms in the past and have never had any issues with them.

So we come back to change into our cloths and he once again got bombard again and was  made to leave making us miss our trip that cost approx $100. As I was making this complaint I was reassured they could not kick us out.  However once the hotel found out about our complaint we did get kicked out.

After sending pictures of a dirty single room motel room which was supposed to be a deluxe double they told me they had to contact the motel and I’d hear back in 5 days…. 6 days later I hear the motel refused to do anything about it and there was nothing they can do. A month later of countless emails (still ongoing) they have me at a measly 180 dollar credit on my booking wallet towards my next stay. I already told them before I went on vacation I would never use the services again so how would 180 credit help me in any way when I won’t be using them in the future….

However, the real rip-off is in the way they treat their accommodation providers, especially the smaller businesses.  They take 15% of what the customer pays and then charge the establishment a significant fee for handling the money, which they make sure they have held on to long enough to cream off another little bit in interest.  On top of that they are really quite inefficient, and, as a hotel owner (small 8 rooms), we are often having to deal with the consequences of their overbooking in the knowledge that the customer will think we have messed it up, not Booking.com.  My advicr to all clients would be: try to find the website of the place you think you would like to go to and book directly.  You will find that almost all hotels, restaurants etc. have human a being at the end of a phone line who can answer your questions and help you make the best decisions.  You may also find reductions or, in most cases, free breakfast and other offers - 15% plus handling fees remember! - most people would rather see their clients happier than pay it out to booking.

2243,Guido D'Angeli,unknown,2021-09-10T13:14:22.000Z,booking.com and its pathological relationship with perfection,"My review on Booking.com regards the client support services for ""partners"".Booking.com denominates ""partners"" hotels and apartment managers offering rooms or apartments through the booking.com platform.Booking.com charge partners a commission for using its platform to promote their hotels/apartments (currently 16/17% of the amount pais by final clients).For me as a booking.com ""partner"", coming across booking.com customer service has been a terrifying experience.Even when you confront them with an obvious platform malfunction problem and try to explain your reasons, you soon realize that the customer services staff are trained to deny even the most crystal clear evidence of the problem. Often you find yourself talking to staff members who deny what a colleague of theirs said a little earlier, clutching at straws with unrealistic justifications. You are never assigned a ticket code of the issue you submit, so that every time you need to contact customer service, you find yourself talking to a different person and you have to start the explanation from scratch. If you ask that they formalize in writing the existence of a malfunction of the platform that they are willing to verbally acknowledge, they refuse to do so, being sure that they can make people believe they live in an ideal world free of imperfections.I highly recommend to all travelers who consult booking.com, to simulate a reservation through the platform for the structure they have chosen and then open a blank Google page and type in the name of the same property.In most cases, the traveler will find a webpage with the same photos and information available on booking.com, but also the telephone number of the strucure (hotel or apartment) of her or his interest.The traveler can directly call the structure to negotiate a significant discount on the rate appeared on booking.com.

At the time, there were 4 rooms available. At 2am this morning, I received an email to say the booking had been cancelled, TWO WEEKS before the date. The email stated that the hotel requested the booking was cancelled due to overbooking, so I contacted the hotel. They said they didn't cancel it, it was booking.com that had cancelled it and that they had no rooms available for me to rebook directly. So I spoke to customer service at booking.com and was told by the lady, that the hotel had cancelled the booking, not them. Now someone is lying is to me. I also can't understand how they can overbook. Surely my name would've been allocated to the room I chose back in Feb, no matter whether I booked directly, or via a third party. I had booked two nights as my husband is DJing at the event on the evening of 25th September, but also, it was a treat for our anniversary, so was looking forward to the little getaway from home.

I arrived to The Draper Hotel at 7pm this Friday September 3rd, 2021. Upon arrival I was told by the front desk that I did not in fact have a reservation for their hotel, leaving me stranded in Manhattan on a Friday night. I was informed by the receptionist that the issue has been ongoing since 11am that morning. An entire 8 hours passed from the onset of this issue and my arrival, and there was NOTHING being done to rectify the issue. I was offered the customer service number to booking.com and told that I will probably be given another hotel- probably. Frustrated and now left panicked that it was late and I had nowhere to stay I called the number to no avail. Nobody answered the line for an hour and it was now 8pm. The receptionist at the front said that the NH hotel around the corner may have available rooms, and that we should try there. Luckily they did have space, but it was significantly more expensive than my initial booking. If I had known in advance that The Draper Hotel would not have availability that night I could have found a better deal somewhere else. Baffled and having already paid in full for my room through booking.com I now had to shell out an additional $322 dollars just to have a place to sleep. My experience in Manhattan on Friday night was both stressful and frustrating, not knowing where I would be sleeping that night despite having done everything I could on my end to ensure a smooth check-in. The lack of coordination between your company and The Draper Hotel for those guests arriving under the assumption that they had a place to stay is absolutely unacceptable.

That so called travel agency had charged the guest, but didn't care to pay to us. They provided unavailable or incomplete credit card details, did not respond to messages and lied to the guest on the phone saying they payed to Booking.com and they make business together with Booking.com so everything is ok. We had to charge the guest. That way the guest had to pay twice for their booking. We provided all necessary support to help the guest get a refund for their card payment to the fraudulent company so that part is settled.We reported to Booking.com our experience and the fraudulent activity the company is engaged in, hoping they will investigate and asking for an assurance for that on their part. Instead of taking ownership and starting to investigate the issue that some thieves are using the Booking.com platform to steal money from people, Booking.com tried to translate the responsibility to us, the property owners, who are victims of these fraudulent activities. All we got as an answer was the advise to setup a security deposit or simply to cancel a reservation. When I explained that this does not resolve anything, because the fraudulent company does not inform guests of cancelled reservations. Then again you are stuck with an arriving customer who has payed, their money is gone, and has no idea their booking is cancelled. A horrible situation for us, the property owners, and the guests.

Their pricing is no longer trustworthy. I have lost all faith in the company. I booked a hotel for xx amount and received a confirmation email containing the amount stated at checkout, BUT, my credit card was charged a completely different amount!! I'm unsure how this is legal or possible - to show me one amount when entering my credit card, then to email me a confirmation with the same amount shown at checkout, BUT then to charge my credit card a completely different amount. In this case the amount was about $75 more than the agreed price stated at checkout, for a one night stay! The difference was huge. I get notifications on my phone when I use my credit card, so immediately the notification appeared on my phone and within 5 minutes I called booking.com to inquire about the charge and cancel the booking. I spent hours on the phone with booking.com who gave me the run around.  What was most frustrating was that the customer service rep and her manager acknowledged that the amount on the website was the correct amount and that they were not sure why I was being charged a different amount. After booking.com called the hotel, the hotel stated that there were other fees, including extra taxes, service and cleaning fees that we're not stated on booking.com but should have been included in that price... It turns out the hotel was new to the platform and didn't enter the information correctly so the price didn't show correctly. EVEN SO, BOOKING.COM AND THE HOTEL REFUSED TO CANCEL MY RESERVATION. Even though both parties we're at fault.. yet somehow I got stuck paying $75+ extra for a 1 night stay. I also couldn't believe they refused to cancel when I called them 5 minutes after booking to address the issue.

I called back and spoke to a lady and she confirmed what I had booked and paid for. Even my account confirmed what I had booked …… 2 king beds and 2 queen beds. Thing is when I told her what I actually received, I incorrectly said the apartment consisted of 1 king in the first bedroom, 1 queen in the second and 2 twin in the 3rd bedroom.

No answer to which it would be so I paid it manually after they didn't take it automatically from my payment card. They then proceeded to take the full balance without taking the £375 deposit into consideration.....been asking for a refund even since (3 weeks now) . Have used this company before many times and never had an issue. To add insult to injury the holiday was awful ...really upsetting and not restful. Being passed from pillar to post and been told this refund is in process multiple times but it never appears.

Called back today on 9-2 and was told that booking.com sent my refund request to the refund department and it will take 1-2 weeks to issue the refund and another 3-5 days to see the refund on my CC.

I contacted the hotel directly to ask about parking and they confirmed I was booked in. On arrival at the hotel after an eight hour motorbike journey we were told the booking had been cancelled two days previously by booking.com. After three hours on the phone, mostly on hold, a booking.com rep said good news! I’ve got you another room. It’s £270. The refund for the original booking (£99) will be refunded when I send receipt of the £270 payment. I did not have £270 for this alternative purchase. At great risk to himself my companion had to ride home eight hours in the dark. I was not fit to do this and I had to spend the night in the street. We both missed attending the MotoGP at Silverstone as a result of Booking.com. The reps were totally unsympathetic and unhelpful. I still have had no refund, no apology and no offer of compensation. This was one of the worst experiences of my life. I feel I’ve been ripped off by a criminal organisation. These practices of extracting money from people, then failing to provide accommodation must be illegal, it’s certainly wholly unscrupulous.Having now read many similar reviews I am shocked that this company is permitted to take peoples money and fail to deliver agreed services.

I was mortified that my Father in particular could have been vulnerable were it not for the ingenuity of hotel staff. Booking.com created unnecessary anxiety in what should have been a lovely trip for my Father - as we were not sure to receive accommodation at all.

Guess what, the owner told us the same.However, more worryingly she said we can stay but she wasn’t sanitising or cleaning the property to safeguard from COVID until the next day as she had plans that evening, although she had enough time for us to go and get a €300 CASH deposit which we stupidly gave her. We where extremely shocked to discover that while Spain and the Balearics are still on Amber alert that we where being left to stay at a property that hadn’t been prepared or cleaned in line with Covid guidelines, by a property managed by one of the best known agencies on the planet.We had no option than to go buy cleaning products and disinfectants and throughly clean the property as we had no where to stay that evening. Needless to say we left quickly the following day and found safe and clean accommodation at our own additional cost.We thought COVID was being taken seriously in the Balearics. We have passed on our findings to the local authorities. Bookiply are aware but don’t seem to be bothered at all. How many other villas is this happening and will the Balearics ever get the green light with behaviour like this from the largest holiday agency on the island.And it doesn’t end here, the whole place is dirty and uncared for and the owner nor the agents don’t help at all. Filthy beds, pillows, bathrooms and generally run down and unclean.

We had an apartment booked for a night away which upon calling the host the evening before after attempting to email him with no response to discuss check in etc, he said he had cancelled this ages ago with booking.com and couldn’t accommodate us. Upon calling yourselves, no one knew anything about it. Instead of doing anything about it at first, we spent 3 hours trying to get someone to listen only to be told that ‘our booking stands’ you have to ‘wait for written confirmation from the host’ one person even said they ‘assume for now we have spoken to someone unrelated to this’ despite us having called the host from the number on your site. You refused to call him saying the time was ‘inappropriate’ despite it only being 8.30pm, finally relenting at almost 11pm and ringing him which is an inappropriate time for him to tell you the same thing. Until this point, no one would believe us, you were even telling us we had to turn up at the apartment and if we were unable to gain access you would ‘look into’ finding us an alternative. This is absolutely disgusting - why should my wife and I, along with a group of our friends to celebrate my wife’s birthday, make a 2 hour journey not knowing if we actually have somewhere to stay just because no one believes us? When he did confirm, no one really apologised for their previous attitudes. You also refused to just transfer our booking elsewhere which is what we wanted - instead you offered to refund the money which will take a number of days (not good enough, the trip away is the next day, hence why a transfer would’ve been simpler for ourselves and your company), and sent us a possible alternative which you may give us a ‘possible refund’ of the extra if we invoice you but we have to fork out upfront with no guarantee of a refund and no idea of when that may be paid. The alternative you suggested was nearly £500 which having already paid for one apartment which we are now waiting for money back on, and this being way out of our budget regardless and significantly more expensive than our original apartment we simply cannot do, especially with the refund afterwards being ‘possible’ not ‘guaranteed’. We have had no choice but to book significantly cheaper accommodation elsewhere which is still more expensive than our original choice due to the short notice, and you obviously won’t help us with the costs for because it’s not somewhere ridiculously expensive that you have recommended. We had already paid for travel and booked things for during our stay which we couldn’t afford to lose money on, therefore cancelling the trip wasn’t really an option either. We will now be a further £117 out of pocket. To add insult to injury you are STILL advertising the apartment on your site for the next few days even though the host has definitely told you now he cannot have guests at the minute. I think it’s absolutely disgusting how you dealt with us, you have found no satisfactory resolution, you all just kept repeating yourselves instead of finding a new option to help, we weren’t believed in the first instance and have wasted several hours on the phone with you to just be left more frustrated and upset. My wife and I, and our friends will not be using yourselves anymore which is a shame because until this point I have always booked through you, and I will be making sure as many people are aware of how we have been treated as possible so they don’t use you either. To be compensated somehow or have some sort of gesture of goodwill from yourselves for the extra costs we are incurring, the time we have wasted trying to resolve this, and the stress due to the appalling way this was handled would be appreciated.",1,1,en,Bookingstar1

We spent 2hrs in the car park on the phone with an advisor (mostly on hold) who wasnt able to get his supervisor on the phone. He provided a refund (without our agreement) and wanted an additional payment to book a studio flat in Kent as an alternative. As I explained this was not suitable as an alternative paid accommodation, he offered a 1 bedroom flat 60 miles away. We spent an additional 2hrs in the small town on/off the phone with other advisors trying to speak with a supervisor, and get somewhere to stay. The supervisor finally got on the phone at 8pm, being very pedantic and blaming the cabin owner, although our payment was sent to them as the agent. She refused to provide emergency stay without us paying again, even though I explained I didn't have an additional £360 in the bank.

2438,carlos wittke,unknown,2021-08-24T19:06:49.000Z,This company is criminaI,"This company is criminaI. They stole my money. I booked a car rental in San Diego about a month in advance. They instantly charge my CC $270 for a four day rental. When I arrived to San Diego and went to the car rental company (Mex Rent a car) The lady was rude and insisted I purchase their insurance at $80 per day rate. I explained that my insurance carrier covered rentals and she became upset. She demanded proof of insurance. I showed her my insurance card on my app from my insurance, but she said that was not enough. I then showed her where the listed covered drivers were and she stated that she could not accept that either. She once again told me to purchase their insurance and I told her I was not going to because my insurance covered rentals. She then said nothing and cancelled my reservation and I was stranded. I called booking.com and was on hold to speak to someone for an hour and 40 minutes. When I finally spoke to someone, they told me all I could do is wait until my rental period was over (4 days) and then file a complaint online on their website. I did that. I received an email about 3 weeks later that they would ""investigate"". I then received another email shortly after stating that they needed my flight information and the time I showed up to pick up the vehicle. I sent them that information. I then had to wait another couple of weeks before they sent me any type of response. The last response told me that the car rental company had up to 30 days to respond. I emailed them once again asking why was taking so long. I told them that I was not provided with a vehicle and that I was owed $270. They did not provide a service to me and it was through no fault of my own. I received a call from Ruan about a week after I emailed them. He told me that they had concluded the investigation and that they decided I was at fault because I did not provide a letter from my credit card company stating that I was insured and able to drive the vehicle. I have never heard of such nonsense and I have rented many cars in my life. I told him I provided the proper insurance information and that the clerk just cancelled my reservation. I once again told them it was not my fault and that I did not receive a rental and that I needed to get refunded. He asked me if I had called from the counter and I told him yes but that I was kept on hold for almost two hours. Ruan asked me if I had proof of that phone call. How am I suppose to have proof of being on hold for nearly two hours two months prior. This company is completely unreasonable. I asked for a supervisor and he rudely told me that if I spoke to a supervisor they were just going to tell me the same thing. I then told him I needed to speak to someone that made better decisions. He told me that he could create a ticket and then have a supervisor call me at some time in the future. He said he did not know when because they were extremely busy. The following day Ruan called me again and told me that the supervisor was NOT going to speak to me and that the decision was final and I could do nothing. My only options were to get refunded for only one day  ($67) or nothing at all. I told him that I needed to get the entire refund not just one day. He told me I violated the terms. Ruan was frustrated with me and he told me he was not going to go back and forth with me and that was it. This company stole my money. I did nothing wrong. I showed proof of insurance. I was treated very poorly and was left stranded. This company is an absolute fraud. I would never recommend this to any person for a hotel, or vehicle.

They tend to just transfer your requests to another department and then another or you get a link to some useless online form and chatbots that don't help at all. Plus it takes forever to reach anyone, so I'm really really disappointed with the service and will now start using other booking platforms with (hopefully) more customer-oriented approach as there's enough competition ont he market. They also seem to be extremley unaligned with actual hotels as I've experienced many times that the hotel claims extra taxes at checkout and insists that breakfast was not included in the rate even though Booking.com's confirmation clearly states that all these chargers are included in the final price. Thus I encourage everyone to make screeshots when booking and making sure you keep all your booking confirmations saved on your mobile or printed to hand them to the hotel staff if they charge you more than they should. It's really frustrating that we as customers and guests have to bear this issues, but unless they resolve this on their side, I cannot give a positive mark as my experience is many times ruined by this lack of help and unwillingness to create a better overall customer experience.",1,2,en,Bookingstar1

The automated email, from the owner stated that the keys were in a locked box on the wall at the house and needed a PIN code. The owner seemed friendly and there was a mobile number and email to contact owner with queries, such as where to eat out. I phoned number which did not have a personalised message, to ask for the PIN and left a message with my number and email for contact. Next day no response so tried them both again and then contacted booking.com by phone, which is well hidden on their site. Explained I was getting worried as not had response and did not want to travel over 200 miles and not have access to property. Agent phoned owner and left message! Over next few days none of my calls and emails through booking. Com website were answered.Surely booking.com would check the contact details for the owner, both mobile and email to check they were working? They assured me all properties are vetted but some reviews had pointed out some minor fixture and fittings issues. I was getting panicky as no contact, but booking.com said it was not a problem we should check in16.00. If access could not be gained they would try to contact owner again with one final email and phone call, and if no response, after 30 minutes would try to get us another property off their site or other ‘platform.’ This was worrying as lots of places were booked as it was school,holidays. This would all be done while we are sat outside in our car! We would still have to book this through their site and pay for it! They would then pay the difference when I send them an invoice.  They did not understand that we did not want to drive such a difference with the chance of getting in. First agent based in Singapore and chat agent in Holland. The day before I was considering booking another place but fortunately I did not as was sceptical of recovering money. On the morning of travel received automated email from owner at 08.57 with the PIN so we got in on arrival. The property was ok but some of the repairs to showers and fittings still not done. After a couple of days there we got email saying my request had been passed in to the owner! A complete disregard of the fact we were already in the property. I wasted hours trying to chase owner and went round in circles trying to get answer.The property still had shower panels missing and some metal door handles were glued on with wood glue but as there were only three of us in property it did not affect us and the property was very good. Dealing with booking.com was very frustrating as they only act as agent and despite them pressing for answers none were received.

In fact it was clear Booking.com had not checked the authenticity of the advertising or visited the property! It was 2 minutes from a station and on the river bank lived tramps alcoholics and drug addicts, whilst outside the entrance prostitutes were working by piles of rubbish with rats! There were none of the above items and the disappointment on my husband's face was terrible to see! No pool or jacuzzi were available just a dirty, dark cottage with a tiny balcony and no view because of the overgrown trees in the neighbouring gardens! After a 7 hour long drive and with no choice we stayed one night! Then went to friends to decide what to do. Imagine the shock when we returned to find the owner had rebooked the property to a Dutch client and all the food and some personal items were ""gone"" I then had to hastily find alternative accommodation and was not surprised to find a review on booking.com by the dutch client echoing my feelings. We both agreed it was dirty! Unsuitable and the owner was aggressive and abusive when we both asked for refunds as 700€ for one sleepless night is unacceptable! I have of course complained to booking.com and have heard nothing for almost a month so don't expect a refund or booking.com to do anything about this situation. I am however in touch with the Carcasonne prefecture who according to government officials are keen to deal with this type of scam as it is fraud. I feel terribly let down by booking.com and will not be using them again in the future and advise anyone to be careful as the advertising is certainly not accurate in many cases, and they need to get their inspection of properties advertised done regularly to protect their customers.

If they wanted on purpose to do something totally bad and deficient, I'm not sure they could do it any better.Be warned, everything will fail, they will not answer, and if they do, they will actually tell you that it's your fault if their app bugs, if they do mistakes, or if they are unreachable, instead of apologizing!This is one of the worst customer service I saw in my life (when you actually can talk to a support, I am currently trying to call their hotline that is advertised as available 24/7, but the call doesn't even connect since this morning, you just get a robot saying no one is available hahaha)Some more facts about my most unpleasant adventure with Booking, for the fans of absurd, Kafka, and big corporations lying to and stealing paying customers:- I booked a hotel, and chose to pay a bit higher price, because it was supposed to include a free taxi ride from the airport (to register 48h prior to arrival)- At the right time, &lt 48h prior, when I wanted to confirm the taxi ride, the start seemed nice, I could fill in flight number and all information... then at the last step of the form, I got an error message ""Unknown error, please retry later""- I retried many times, I tried on a different name, etc, nothing worked- I could only access the application at this time, and it was impossible to find one phone number to contact, one email address, one chat, nothing, so after many tries I could only give up- The next day, I tried again from my computer, of course it was too late so the free option was unavailable, but I did find a phone number to call- I talked to a 1st lady about my issue, saying that I had a screenshot of the bug of the application, but she was very insistent that it was my own fault, that she couldn't find a trace of my free taxi ride, and that a screenshot with a page of their own application that had the title ""FREE TAXI RIDE"" and the error message was not receivable... even when I tried to say, well how could have I arrived on this page if I didn't have the option, or when I defended that Booking should know what is on their website, not me, I got no apologies, she was very sure it was my own fault, and of course could not transfer me to anyone else in charge- Luckily, I could find again the initial e-mail including the written free taxi ride, so I called Booking again, and I talked to a nicer agent.. Spent 1h on the phone, sent her the screenshot, she went to an expert... to finally tell me they could not do anything, because I was calling them too late (of course, since the numbers are impossible to find!!). It ended up with a promise, not even of a refund, or anything, but of APPLYING for a refund (let's see if they are gonna scam me again)Then, it's not over... this is where I did a stupid mistake, because I thought I would go through Booking again to book a paid ride from the airport... Thinking naively that going with the same operator would allow me more easily to be paid back and get my promised gratuity. What a deep deep error.At 1st, everything seemed fine, the taxi was booked and registered... the issue arrived when our initial flight was delayed, the connecting flight postponed, and we had to try reaching Booking to change the arrival time!Then the same crazy story starts all over again:- When you go to manage your booking on their app, they'll say that the time is too short to update online, so you should contact them directly (this is when you start knowing you will get scammed again by these thieves!)- Again, impossible to find one chat, you look for the help and land on a page saying ""how can we help you?"" like there would be a form to fill, but no form, just an empty page...- I did find 2 numbers on the booking taxi ""manage your reservation"" thing, one number from Booking itself, and one from the taxi company ""grand class"" (very ironic name)- Of course, the number from Booking is the one that is not connecting for the whole day, and actually impossible to reach! So you can't do any changes, and the 24/7 support is just a huge scam!- Then you call the taxi company, the 2nd number displayed.. people actually answer, and are much nicer.. but they tell you they can't do anything, and that you should talk with Booking (lol)- You will try explaining to the taxi company that Booking is impossible to reach, that they are so bad nothing works, and that you have to change the reservation otherwise one taxi will go to the airport for nothing, while the same ride will be needed a few hours later...- The taxi company will take your reservation number, and promise that Booking should call you back quickly- Do you think Booking called back? anyone wants to bet? of course they never did",1,0,en,Bookingstar1

We had already paid £281.87 well in advance to rent car from SIXT and were left with no choice but to pay the extortionate amount of £701.50 to rent a car from Enterprise at the last minute. I have sent 7 emails to booking.com along with a letter of complaint but all I get back are generic emails from them looking a pin number which we haven’t got ad this has been explained to them several times. We have tried ringing but you can’t connect to a customer advisor without a pin number. I am claiming a full refund of £271.87 for a car we weren’t able to rent and also £419.63 which is the extra money we had to spend to rent the other car. I should not suffer a financial detriment because booking.com did not make me aware that you needed to bring both parts of the licence. Both booking.com and SIXT need to update their instructions specific to Northern Ireland customers as it is unclear and misleading. A company adjacent to SIXT were able to offer us a car without both parts of the licence so clearly one rule for one and one for another. It jaded our holiday and caused unnecessary stress financially. I have been left very frustrated by booking.com they have not acknowledged my letter nor the emails I have sent. It would appear that they have no intention of addressing my concerns and hope that I will just give up and go away but I have no intention of doing that. I am hoping that someone takes time to read this and any advice on next steps would be appreciated. I was a very good customer of booking.com and prior to this I would have championed their good customer service, but after this experience I will not be using them again.",1,0,en,Bookingstar1

Plus we had two vulnerable adults in the group.1. needed electricity to power his oxygen unit to sleep (could die if no oxygen during his sleep)2. The other mental and stress issues that if over stressed brings on epilepsy.We contacted Booking.com and eventually got hold of a lady called Farha E Customer Service Team. she led us to believe she had booked us an apartment in Skegness as we stressed we ere unable to drive to due to drinking.The apartment was 40 miles away! so we tried to call Farha back and due to her cancelling the booking for the Grovenor we were just cut off with no way of contacting Booking.com.It occurred on: 14/08/2021This meant that We had to re-asure our vulnerable adults that we would sort this out and find rooms.Gordon and I walked the streets from 3pm to 7pm going from bedsit/ hotel door to door asking for rooms.Eventually we found one room in the Queens 49 Scarborough Avenue for £99.00 (one double room and not allowed 2 men in the bed) 1 room sorted for Steve with oxgen issue.Then room two was in Chatsworth Skegness so the other vunrable adult in a room with no one to oversee him (But he was now sorted) £80.00Finally in Driftwood b&b we found a double room that Gordon and i shared a double bed (Not ideal) £125.00Total outlay was £304.00 Stress levels very high.Our plan was to arrive at 2pm get into our rooms and get our heads down for 4 hours sleep and freshen up, as we had been travelling since 5am (Total time travelling 9 hours)By the time we found and secured our rooms transfered more money over there was no time for rest. We were on with our evening, since that is what we came to Skegness for.we feel due to the way Booking.com and OYO just abandoned us 300 miles away from home with no help or assistance, they should be paying us at least £200.00 each to cover our whole nights expenses and travel as the weekend was practically written off.I look forward to your prompt response on this matter.

2578,Erwan Prou,unknown,2021-08-13T15:34:48.000Z,So many problems,"So many problems, no solution1st problem : I made a reservation at a special date, but few days after, someone of Booking call me to said me that my reservation need to be undo because it was already pick by someone else. Why they let me take those date if it's already taken !?2nd problem : During this phone call, they said to me that they will send me other reservation that are similar. The phone call stop and when I have checked the proposals: it is less well placed and more than twice the price of the original reservation (which was already expensive). So I gave up to find other reservation on their site.3rd problem : I gave up their website, but my reservation is still active and needs to be canceled. Problem : when I click on the button to undo this reservation, it said to me that it will send an email to confirm my decision. I never receive any other mail from booking since their other proposals, so, since the end of July, I tried more than ten times to cancel my reservation without it working.4th problem : Sometimes I saw that the site tells me that I need to contact the guys who own the house to confirm the cancellation. But when I click on the button to contact him, it send me on their ""Message"" option, but I can't write any message.5th problem : Sometimes, still to be able to cancel my reservation, the site tells me to contact customer service. When I click on the button to do it, it send me on the FAQ of the website so it won't help me. But a button to contact them directly exist ! When I click on it : it send me on the same ""Message"" option, so like the 4th problem, I can't contact them by writing. So when I want to contact them by phone, only one number is free. But when I call it, it doesn't work and I need to close the call.So today my reservation n°3983281179 (if a guy of Booking.com see my message) is still active, and the date is coming quickly (17th August) before I need to pay to cancel it (because I paid extra for free cancellation !) and I don't want to paid for something that I can't go.I will never go again on this site to made any reservations.

2583,Richard H,unknown,2021-08-12T21:47:03.000Z,The very worst customer service you can imagine….,"I have been a Booking.com customer for years, having booked many hotel stays for both business and holidays.   Today, for the first time, I discovered what this company is like if you have a query.  The experience was enough to ensure that I will never again use their services. Simply the worst customer service you can imagine. I used Kayak to look for a one-way car hire deal and it quoted an all inclusive price of £149, before passing me through to Booking.com.  I proceeded to book - at £148.50 - on Booking.com and, after a short time, I received my confirmation email.  I was surprised to see that the email mentioned an extra “one-way” charge of £48 that it said I needed to pay on collecting the car.  I knew for certain that the one-way fee had been in the price quoted.  I was able to replicate the deal by going through another quotation and, sure enough, it stated that the one-way fee was included.  It therefore seemed likely that the email from Booking.com was in error, but I thought I’d better check. On contacting the customer support team via web chat, and waiting ages in a queue, I was told that the £48 did indeed apply and that I needed to “accept it” on the website.  The agent didn’t seem to know which website he was talking about or where I would accept it, and then the chat disconnected. I decided to call customer services by phone, instead. I thought that the original agent must have misunderstood the issue.  After another long wait in a queue, I explained everything again to the phone agent and pointed out that the £148.50 that I had been quoted seemed to have turned into £196.50.  She offered no explanation for this and insisted it was all part of the car hire firm’s terms and conditions!  When I asked her to cancel the booking, she told me I would receive no refund! I pointed out that this was tantamount to fraud, but she followed her script telling me that I had accepted the terms etc.! 2 further web chats were needed before I finally got an agent (thanks Lloyd) to grudgingly agree to cancel and refund the money at some point in the next 5 working days.  No apology. No explanation for the ridiculous attitude adopted. Incidentally, the car rental company was Budget and its own website offered exactly the same deal - £148.50 - inclusive of a £40 one-way fee.  So I’m 99.9% certain that the Booking.com email just contained an error.  But the shocking lack of knowledge of the customer service team and the cavalier attitude towards misrepresentation means I can never again use this organisation.",1,1,en,Bookingstar1

Unfortunately I was on the phone for more than a hour being transferred and left on hold from team member to team member. I spoke with a Nicole and a Kira, I was then told by Kira that Nicole said there was not a manger on site. I was also told that they were booked to capacity. I was frustrated because I was being charged more through a third party than I would have been charged through IHG. Once arriving I was checked in by a very nice young lady named Shalise. She was new but she went above and beyond to help me. I explained that I was to have a two bedroom she explained that what was booked through the third party was a one bedroom with two beds. I asked to speak with the manager it took about 30 minutes for Darrion to come over. I explained the situation to him, I showed him the time stamp on my phone of how long I had been being left on hold. He said he knows the two young ladies and he would speak with them. He never offered to charge me the rate of a IHG member he said I can charge you $120.00 more dollars to correct the room. The room I was assigned to was dirty. The ceiling in the living room next to the sliding door looks soft with a dip like it would cave in. Spider Webs were on the lamp shade, hair in the bathroom sink and shower. The carpet was filthy!!! I feel I was purposely assigned to a few of there worse rooms by Darrion. My room # was 2200 Springer from 8-5 to 8-8 . I heard him talking about some rooms being recently remodeled . He explained to the front desk girl that she would know by color if it’s blue or green. The towels didn’t look clean, I called the front desk I was told that they do not give new towels we would need to was and dry them. I explained to her that we had been gone to Disney springs all day. We never used the towels so why would we wash them. We needed a frying pan to make breakfast for the kids. We were advised they were out of frying pans. Later we were told they found a pan we could used but was warned that it was stainless steel. We needed the sheet for the sofa bed that had a huge brown stain on the mattress. We were told they only had one runner at night and it would take about 45 minutes. I asked if I could pick it up I was told NO. I have stayed here several times, I have never had a experience such as this.

I decided not to follow this up as my husband and I were looking forward to our night away and were unlikely to cancel. The day before our stay someone in my husbands office at work who he’d had contact with tested positive to COVID and he was sent home from work to isolate. We therefore had to cancel. I firstly phoned the hotel who said as he booking was organised through booking.com they could not organise a refund however booking does not pay for the booking until after our stay so they had no been paid yet and under these circumstances they would not charge so if I spoke to booking they may still be able to refund me. All I had to do was speak to booking and cancel and the rest should be sorted out.I did as she suggested and rang, the automated  message said they were experiencing lots of calls and I could be waiting 20 mins, I waited beyond 20 mins and gave up then tried again later with the same. I then went onto my booking.com account and then noticed I have been charged and my receipt said I was not entitled for a refund. I tried to call again following this and the same happened, I did not get to speak to anyone, the next day and it said 5 mins but waited again for around 30mins with no answer.  I find it appalling that I have not been able to talk to someone to get a refund. That I gave my bank details thinking I would be guaranteeing my stay not paying for it. That I have paid for something booking,com will not have been charged for. And that in these current climates with people having to cancel at short notice with COVID related issues booking.com are able to sell bookings with no easy method of being refunded. The hotel was more supportive than booking.com. In future I will book direct with the hotel and miss out bookin.com altogether.",1,0,en,Bookingstar1

I don't think I have left a review before even when services are subpar but this one took the prize home for absolute shocking!! Customer experience guys....the emphasis being 'customer!!!'.  It was practically impossible to reach them. 'Are they even real?' I began to wonder.... I had an issue with the booking and tbh I wasnt too bothered about the actual issue but the fact that I could NOT contact anyone in booking.com for over 2HOURS  was absolutely shocking!! I couldn't email them within the app or via their desktop site - all their messenger options for live chat or 'message customer support' landed on a blank chat that remained inactive. You couldn't input text period. This was the case on a few browsers.The hotel staff themselves were quite decent when I called them directly but fair enough, they could do little given the booking was made by the insufferable booking.com crowd.Then the challenge of trying to reach them on phone(!) The two numbers booking.com provided on the 'contact support' page of their website left me on hold on each of them for OVER an hour. After 2 hours and a bit on hold to loop music, I had to hang up!I eventually googled a third number online to contact them and got the same automated mssg that put me on hold AGAIN. This time seemed slightly less painful, possibly about 20 minutes of hold then bingo(!) someone emerged.In all fairness she sounded sorry and open to helping but at the end of the 'help' I got landed with a further bill of over 100 bucks and a 'sorry there's nothing we can do'.Booking.com please revisit your customer experience design......it needs not only a MAJOR overhaul but an upgrade after that just to bring it up to standard.Thanks for wasting over 2 hours of time and billing us for it.My advice, if you can book elsewhere, please do or from the hotel, flight operator directly.....assuming you don't have time to waste on this lot.",1,1,en,Bookingstar1

I immediately looked up my rights and learnt that (according to the Consumer Rights Act 2015) I had a right to a choice between a full refund or substitute accommodation that was as good in quality and as good of a location as my original booking, as well as encoring no extra cost to my original payment. The trader is to pay the difference.Over 6 hours on hold later - so to cut a very long story short - I was led round in circles, booking.com never responded to emails and would only phone me with their responses (so I started recording our phone calls in prep for the court case).They ended up never replying to me emails or phone calls, blocked on some numbers.They left me stranded and homeless, with no international minutes left to call them with (they don't have a UK phone number and just don't respond to emails). They told me 2 different reasons for the cancellation - emergency maintenance and overbooking, so somewhere a lie was going on although the reason for cancellation was none of my business all that concerned me was where I was going to stay instead as I had already paid in full).They had 8 alternative accommodations available on their website but wouldn't give them to me as they were 'too expensive' - I know that they're extortionate, obviously booking hotels the day before is exceptionally expensive, that's why I didn't do that and booked months in advance! That's why I was was explicitly requesting that I didn't get a refund - the money I paid a month ago would neverrrr cover the cost of the same nights away booked the day before check in!Instead, they 'offered' me an Airbnb - which I don't consider an offer as they were asking me to enter a new contract that had nothing to do with them, meaning that they could very easily not refund me for it, leading me to losing an awful lot of money. They offered no details whatsoever about how they would cover the cost of this, so of course I was uncomfortable booking something when left in the dark about how this would be paid for. As it was all so last minute before check in, the AirBnb got booked up by someone else anyway, during one of the many many hours I was on hold for.I could not be more appalled. They were the superlative of an awful experience leaving me UNSAFE, homeless, confused, scared, lost for a lot of money, etc etc. BOOKING.COM NEEDS TO BE SHUT DOWN AND THE PEOPLE IN CHARGE - PEPJIN RIJVERS, GILLIAN TANS ETC. - SHOULD BE INCREDIBLY ASHAMED!!!!!!!!!!

Booking.com refusing any sort of refund, compensation or even to remove the  of the listing. I emplore everyone to report booking.com to the their relevant Consumer Market Authority. For the UK, this is the CMA, and you can report them for not having clear information (i.e. ""accurate"" and ""not misleading, both in action or omission"").More information: none of the following were provided in the property despite being listed - safety deposit box (I consider essential for passport, valuables, etc), television, pay-per-view service, streaming service, mosquito net, fireplace. Booking tried to claim that it was possible that some of these features may have temporarily been missing - how they deem a structural feature like a fireplace might have possibly been temporarily removed is beyond me. After the first phone call asking the property about the missing items (to which, they feigned not speaking English, but being conversational Spanish, I just asked in Spanish instead), they admitted they were missing then hung up. The property won't accept any of my calls now, and the person here states they are only the manager and that the issue is with the owner. Booking.com also contacted them, to which they admitted to them that the information was inaccurate, but after them asking for a cancellation (on the first day) then requesting early check-out (which they completely ignore), the property is then just refused their calls too. Despite this and calls each day to Booking.com, the advert is still up, with all the false information. I have been trying to get Booking.com to remove the listing and in allowing it to continue (despite the property admitting it was false) Booking.com is knowingly compliant with this fraudulent activity.Again, I implore everyone to report Booking.com to the Consumer Market Authority.",1,1,en,Bookingstar1

2768,invierna Wang,unknown,2021-07-29T21:50:05.000Z,This issue is about an incident related to misinformation and abuse of cancellation rules,"This issue is about an incident related to cancellation and refund request based on misinformation and abuse of cancellation rules. My experience: I booked a hotel room with “Hotel Torres Del Mar in Puerto Viejo, Costa Rica” via booking.com. Upon confirmation, I notice that almost all reviews show that the hotel has been trapping tourists using deceptive pictures. I immediately raised my concerns over this to the hotel but instead of answering my question, the hotel immediately took my money from the credit card I saved, and came back to me with a delayed response telling me that tourists who posted the reviews misunderstood general pictures for the rooms. I have checked other portals such as Expedia and Google Map, and I am pretty sure that reviews on all these different platforms have been pointing out the same thing that the hotel is using fake pictures, among its many other problems in aspects of sanitation, security, rudeness, electric wires exposure on the shower, and trying to scam the tourists for money. All these comments are well-written by authentic real users from worldwide. In order to avoid further risks and unpleasantness, I requested the hotel to cancel my booking and refund the amount of money they have just took a few minutes ago (it is still 4 days before check-in). But the hotel replied with again a delayed response saying that I have missed the 1 hour cancellation period (which is unreasonably short anyway), and they refuse to communicate with me, telling me to contact booking.com. I contacted booking.com but was only replied with my request for cancellation denied, and they cannot do anything about this. By the time, 20 hours have passed since I proposed my request. I feel the hotel is only intentionally delaying everything so that cancellation would be less possible. This behavior only strengthened my impression that the hotel is trying to fish tourists and rob them. I actually already feel unsafe if I would have to stay there. I am only left with the option between staying with the trapping hotel which I do not trust, or giving up to its deceptive and bully behavior by feeding them with the $165 they have taken for the reservation. I feel this is very unfair. I understand the reservation rule is to protect the guests to secure a room and help the hotel to prepare by not overselling the rooms, but this hotel is obviously making misuse of such mechanism. Moreover, I would like to question the rules of booking.com, which says it cannot do anything in this incident given all above facts that prove this is a scam. I feel the website is not protecting the vulnerable consumers but only the interests of hotels, even obviously dishonest hotels. Although reviews accumulated for many years all display that the hotel has been deceiving and mistreating its consumers. I feel been forced to walk into such a trap even though I have already discovered immediately after the booking, and communicated with all these different parties. While booking.com only acts to protect and support the fraud and robbing of its hotel users by replying to consumers that there is nothing it can do. Note that pictures serve as the most important information source for making decisions in an Internet business like this, and booking.com has been ignoring the complaints over deceptive pictures for many years. When incidents happen, it does not do anything to help the consumer but comply with the hotel, despite that the website is aware of what is the essence of this incident.  I wish booking.com to stop the transaction at this moment, cancel my reservation with full refund, before further harm could occur and help to protect my safety. It might perhaps also consider to fix the deceptive pictures, and give an honest description and rating of the hotel (and make the information obvious) so that there will be no other victims in the future. It could perhaps also review its measurements and procedures to protect consumers against such trapping and deceptive behaviors. So far I have received no reply.",1,1,en,Bookingstar1

(+ 44 20 3320 2609. I think?)at “The Chatsworth Hotel” Weymouth 14 The Esplanade, Weymouth, Dorset, DT45 8EB UK. Telephone No. +447977 69948, at a cost of £440.00. For four days from  10th June -14th June 2021 on Bed & Breakfast terms with all normal hotel facilities, I later asked for a room without too many stairs, Chatsworth Hotel said that was OK. I explained direct to the Hotel that because of COVID restrictions I would not pay for this booking until I knew that travel by Railway would be unrestricted. They were okay with that also.When the travel restrictions were lifted - on 17th May  I immediately paid  the whole bill, £440.00 I had been told me that I must pay  by 2nd June. This was okay by me.  This was well before the due date.On the 3rd of June, less than a week before the booking, I received notification that the booking had been cancelled by Bookings.com on the basis that I had not paid the bill before the 2nd of June. The Chatsworth Hotel immediately rebooked the room to somebody else!! Despite having received payment well in advance of our arrival.I of course remonstrated to the Hotel, but they said that they could do nothing! and they had to accept a new booking for what were our dates. After trying to contact Bookings.com (which turned out to be impossible by telephone) I immediately re-contacted the Hotel in a very distressed state-in-deed - I broke down during the telephone conversation (I suffer from a depressive disorder including Anxiety).I called them once again, But they said they could not help me, and the cancellation stood. I immediately requested my money back - which they paid.  I also received a debit of £412.80 from Bookings.com, but they realised their mistake and deleted my account with that £412.80 cancelling out the credit.This cancellation was extremely upsetting for us particularly as my Husband has a depressive disorder which includes anxiety.So, I wish to claim from both of them a payment for loss of value and compensation for the distress that was caused by this error on both of their  parts. I claim a total from you in the sum of £400.00.Section 49 of The Consumer Rights Act 2015 (“the Act”) implies a term into the contract I entered with you, requiring you to carry out your service with reasonable care and skill. Neither of you bothered to check I had already paid! If you had only checked this - error would never have taken place. This constitutes a failure on both your parts.The problems described above show that you failed in your legal obligations. I therefore have a claim against you for breach of contract.And breaches your own standards laid out in your contract. Please note that liability for substandard performance of the services cannot be restricted or otherwise excluded, pursuant to s.57 of the Act, despite any terms and conditions to the contrary. To be clear, these rights act independently of any guarantee that may or may not have been provided in respect of the works. As a result, I look forward to receiving your reply within the next 14 days from the date of this letter.yours sincerely etc.""I  sent this letter to both of them by e-mail and registered mail, with a reply date of yesterday.

I booked a two night stay through Booking.com 12 days in advance of my stay. I received a confirmation and pin upon reserving the stay. While booking the reservation, I hit the selection which stated ""pay at a later date"" because I wanted to pay at the hotel when I got there. The next day, the entire amount was withdrawn from my account. This is where the finger pointing started. I called Tru by Hilton in Jackson Michigan, because that is what my statement said the money went to. They stated they didn't receive the money yet and for me to call Bookings. I call Bookings, they said Tru By Hilton pulled the money and it was out of there hands. So, I said forget it, at least my rooms are paid for. After driving from Virginia to Michigan, over 700 miles, I arrive at the hotel, to find out my reservations had been canceled and there were no more rooms available. More finger pointing starts again here!! The front desks tells me they called me (LIE!!) to tell me the reservations had been canceled the day before, only for the manager to come out, because there was a problem, and say ""well I called most the people. I showed them my call log to show NO ONE called ME!! I even pulled up the email that was sent to me the day before my check-in which stated I could check in early. So........I ask them to refund my money. They stated it has been released back to Bookings but they would try to help find rooms in the nearby vicinity. Which that was THEY ONLY thing they did. I call Bookings, they said the hotel still has the money and has not released it. All the time, I still don't have accommodations yet. I finally locate a room at Hampton Inn in Jackson, (BIG SHOUTOUT TO KIRSTEN, the GM, she told me everything that was suppose to happen and could not believe the situation these 2 sperate companies put me in). After being on hold for an hour, and getting no help at all, I had to pay OUT OF POCKET AGAIN, and hope to get the refund sometime here in the near future.

We booked a Queen Room (Booking.com description) with extra living room space and big bathroom -  we were shown to what I would describe as no more than a standard double room that had no extra living space and we said straight away that the room was not what we expected.  We were advised that they could not put us in a bigger room as there was none available and that Booking.com should not have described the room as a Queen Room as it is a signature double (whatever that means).  It was too late to go anywhere else as we had also booked a table in the hotels restaurant and it was my husbands birthday.  The room was so hot with a totally inadequate fan that was blowing warm air into the room and a small skylight window with a fixed blind that we had to keep wide open all night and that meant we could not close the blind so the sun came streaming into the room at dawn.  It was without doubt the worse nights sleep we have ever had and the most uncomfortable night too.  When we complained we were told to contact booking.com who are passing the buck back to the Hotel and we are stuck in the middle.  This is a complaint of a totally unrealistic and false description of the room we thought we were going to be staying in with no one taking any responsibility for our complaint.  I have decided not to book with booking.com again as I would rather deal direct with a hotel if I have a complaint which involves a refund direct from the hotel and not be playing ping pong.,1,0,en,Bookingstar1

Do all hotel owners a favour and book direct. The commission they charge is insane, the customer service is woeful. We have a local contact who gets angry if we contact her because 'she's very busy' - we constanly get bookings made with virtual cards that don't recognise the card number when you go to take payments. We constantly get guests who booked with bogus card details, or where no CCV number was required. It's impossible to take payment from those who don't turn up or leave without paying, and any attempt to resolve this at Booking.com's end is met with disdaine and contempt. I'm regularly told it must be a fault at our end because Booking.com doesn't make mistakes. We get bookings which end up in unallocated rooms, and on one occassion this resulted in a guest being able to book into the hotel despite us being full. Everytime I have to phone customer service to resolve one of the issues above I'm put through to a generic help line, despite supposedly having a personal contact. I have to jump through 20 questions related to my property, only to be put through to an advisor who then tells me I need to speak to the reservations team, and after being transfered I have to answer the same bloody questions, only to be told that for security purposes they will need to ring me back, and on several occassions this just simply hasn't happened, meaning I then have to start the process all over again. I've largely given up trying to resolve these issues now as everytime I have to speak to anyone at Booking.com I lose a good hour out of my time at least - and rarely do I get a satisfactory response.

But because I booked through the European platform, the rules were different. During the conversation, Booking.com offered a 50% refund, which at the time I refused and insisted on a full refund because. Once I learned that the rules did not apply in Europe, I reached back to Booking.com to accept the 50% refund and they retracted the offer. It is an extremely frustrating and powerless situation that I don't want anyone else to experience. I lost a substantial amount simply because the person on the other side of the line thought I was not likable. Sure, I was firm in my communication because I believed it was my right to receive the full refund.

Although we had an American Express and three Visas, the rental car agency would not accept it. When we called Rentalcars.com to cancel the booking, they told us they would charge us a fee of 3 days of rental. This is merely stealing people money.

I recently booked a flight from Lisbon to Split, Croatia on June 25, 2021, returning to Lisbon from Dubrovnik on July 4, 2021.  I discovered that my return flight from Dubrovnik was changed without my knowledge.  In fact, Gotogate changed the flight to originate from Split instead of Dubrovnik at 6:40 p.m. July 4, stay overnight in Frankfurt and not arrive back in Lisbon until 11:15 a.m. the next day.  Gotogate blamed the changes on ""the airline"".  I emailed Gotogate within an hour stating that the proposed change was unacceptable and offered Iberian Air and Lufthansa Air flights from Dubrovnik leaving and arriving back in Lisbon on July 4.  Gotogate replied that it could not book me on Iberian Air.  Gotogate did offer another flight from Split, not Dubrovnik, at least leaving and arriving the same day in Lisbon on July 4.  I emailed Gotogate asking about the Lufthansa flight from Dubrovnik which Gotogate's previous email did not address.  Gotogate claimed ""change of departure and arrival city is not allowed as per airline schedule change policy"".  Apparently faced with no options, I twice emailed Gotogate confirming the flight from Split which left and arrived in Lisbon the same day.  On June 25, Gotogate emailed me claiming the return flight previously offered was no longer available.  Instead , Gotogate now claimed I could not return to Lisbon until the next day, July 5.  In response, I twice emailed Gotogate cancelling any return flight to Lisbon it may have booked.  I directly reserved a KLM flight from Dubrovnik as originally planned which left and arrived back in Lisbon the same day, July 4.  Gotogate responded that it would refund the unused portion of my return flight, minus a cancellation fee for the return flights which I did not book in the first instance, and that, ""the handling time for your refund will be longer than usual"".   Gotogate's claim that I could not book a return flight from Dubrovnik supposedly due to the airline's policy is of course absurd.  I strongly advise air travelers to use sites like Booking.com to find the least expensive and/or most convenient flights, and then book such flights directly with the airlines.",1,0,en,Bookingstar1

The pictures showed a nice hotel room, highly rated, in my desired location and within my budget. I’d already booked a nice hotel room through booking.com but was moving after my stay came to an end here, as this one would be closer to where I wanted to be. While in the taxi to go to the new hotel, I immediately felt something was off as the taxi driver spent ages circling around a cul de sac. There were no hotels to be seen anywhere.In the end, he dropped me off and I opened the address in my maps, confirming I was indeed at the right address.  The address was taken directly from Booking.com. This was someone’s private property!! Not a hotel in sight!!I proceeded to call the number for the hotel, again taken directly from booking.com & in my confirmation email from booking.com and the hotel. The number was for a sushi restaurant!!Immediately I knew this was a not a real hotel.I was stranded with my luggage in 41 degrees! Feeling very vulnerable in a place I’ve never been before.I called Booking.com and explained to them my situation. They told me to wait for 30 minutes for the hotel to get back to me.I told them I don’t think this is a real hotel? Given the address and number. They agreed!! But I had to wait anyway as it’s their policy.I was on the phone to them for 4 hours! They were extremely unhelpful, as if they’d heard this story before?All they could offer me was to look for another hotel within my budget and location.They suggested hotels that were 20 and 30 minutes away from my location and way more expensive!! Ones that were 4 and 5 star when I was happy with 3 stars. They even suggested the one I just came from!When they suggested ones that were more expensive I asked how am I to pay for this then? I was expecting them to sort out some sort of deal, as this was entirely their fault for listing a fake hotel and taking my money.Instead, they told me to pay the difference! And if I can’t do this then to ask a friend or family member to pay the difference!!It felt like a joke and all they cared about was making the most money out of my situation.I was so upset and crying to them on the phone. They did not care. They kept me on hold for most of the time. Then continued to suggest more hotels through booking.com! I told them I could do that myself?

Booking.com customer services told me it wasn’t their responsibility I should have checked the hotels website small print . This was booked by them through a partner organisation so nothing to do with them . Apart from loosing 83 euros I was shocked that they took no responsibility for booking this hotel for me with a filter that obviously didn’t work .

The company CEO, Glenn Fogel, couldn't care less about his customers.All my emails to him were ignored.The website provides ZERO liability or refunds, BE AWARE of this sketchy company.",1,0,en,Bookingstar1
2992,Khaled,unknown,2021-07-07T19:07:55.000Z,Was hoping there is zero star but this…,"Was hoping there is zero star but this will do. I had a reservation but day before I arrive I contacted the property and was told I don't have reservation and looks like booking.com over booked on same property. Been offered absolutely no assistance from booking.com tried calling them but all I got was customer service person being rude and harsh on the phone and not willing to help. Been totally left out with no alternative my flights, taxi etc all booked but massively let down by booking.com. Lucky I called to check otherwise would have turned up at the property with no reservation. They said in that case they would have assisted but if they can't assist now I doubt they will when I reach my destination. Think carefully when booking with booking.com its a gamble.",1,1,en,Bookingstar1
2993,Emil D. Rasmussen,unknown,2021-07-07T18:28:22.000Z,Beware: Never use Booking.com for flights,"I’ve used Booking.com for hotels for years. This time I also used them for flights. Huge mistake. Booking.com outsources this without telling the customer. Lufthansa cancelled our return flights and Booking.com informed us of this the night before our departure. Booking.com offered us alternative return flights through Lufthansa, but instead of 1 hour layover like the original tickets, we now had 15 hours and over night as well. I could see on Booking.coms app and website that they had a similar flight to our old flight, but for some reason Shiva would not allow Booking.com’s Indian CS to rebook to this flight instead. This was a short flight from Denmark with layover in Germany. They didn’t even offer us hotel accommodation which is required by EU law. Booking.com has an useless Indian customer service and they are a complete joke. By email they would only offer a refund and asked me to confirm the cancellation. Their phone service was also useless and asked me to call back. I wasted my night and early morning before departure trying to fix it with their useless Indian CS. The only ones who were of help to us were Lufthansa themselves. Their European based customer service was kind and understanding even though we had not directly booked with them. They promised us they would help us rebook our return flights upon arriving in Malta. And they did.I’m a Genius member and have many bookings with Booking.com, but I have lost all trust in them to protect me as a customer. Never again, Booking.com",1,2,en,Bookingstar1

I called customer service and the hotel right away, and booking.com representative assured me that I will not be charged for anything. In five days they charged my bank account and asked for the $164 cancelation fee. They hang up on me or  when I try to talk to customer service again. Horrible",1,0,en,Bookingstar1

I haven’t received a confirmation code nor a 4 digit number 1 whole month later & still nothing. Luckily when I made the booking I took a screenshot of the booking reference but even just with that I cannot contact them. I contacted them via email which even took forever for them to reply only to be told to contact their 24/7 contact car hire & was even asked if I’ve got proof I made the booking. Very bad & careless customer service & will definitely not be using them again. They took my money & haven’t even done their job correctly.,1,0,en,Bookingstar1

I replied that it wasn't fair, as we signed a contract and I already paid and cancelled previous booking. BOOKING itself (the company) cancelled my booking due to an ""extraordinary low price"" that was published by mistake by the owner. When I forgot to cancel a booking within deadline last year there was no possibility to correct my mistake and I lost 700€, this time I lost the booking at a convenient price for a mistake of the owner.
