For example, even though the chosen airlines has no fee for rebooking the tickets, booking.com takes 80 EUR for the same service (after over a week of daily calls to customer service).

6,julie ‚ÄúRedAndGoldWeb‚Äù Wallis,unknown,2022-06-03T10:57:58.000Z,Left without a bed with 2 children.,"I had been using booking.com for many years, until this weekend. I was in london for the jubilee celebrations with my husband and two grandchildren for two nights.Our first night was perfect. Sadly the apartment for the second night (different location) was cancelled by our host (I presume he had forgot to raise his price enough for the jubilee weekend) and booking.com offered us a very poorly rated apartment, outside of central london which would have meant we would have struggled to get to the Mall early. The substitute apartment wanted ¬£700+ ‚Äòsecurity deposit‚Äô and all the reviews were saying it was a scam and they struggled to get their deposits back.Absolutely disgusting to be abandoned several hundred miles from home with two small, tired children when london is at its busiest. Especially bad when booking.com didn‚Äôt even contact me to begin with, they just gave a refund. I struggled with the representative as English was not her first language and her accent made her impossible to understand. She couldn‚Äôt seem to comprehend that a refund was not what we needed, we needed another room.The only reason we found out our apartment was cancelled was because I phoned the place to say we were on our way as the children were tired. I was also told I could not have a refund even though I had already received one, as it was non refundable. I removed my debit card details from booking.com now so they will not be getting paid for the substitute room. But I‚Äôm still out of pocket and will be forever furious that booking.com thought it was ok to just abandon a family. I used to recommend them, now my advice would be do not book through booking.com because if your host cancels then booking.com will happily refund you and abandon you. I was mistaken in thinking they had some responsibility to find you a suitable alternative.I do realise london was busy, the majority of hotels were booked but‚Ä¶booking.com should have done more to help.",2,1,en,Bookingstar2345

Booking replied in a very proper manner, but when we go a solution from their part, we had already got set in another hotel which ended to be a wonderful experience.

The booking was cancelled without reason by the apartment  owners. The owners pocketed our money and would not respond to us at all, or to booking. Booking were supportive. They told us we had to go through the procedure through our bank card. We did this and the bank (Santander) were absolutely  appalling. They put every obstacle they could between us and a refund. We couldn't contact them, the website did not work, we had to send papers by post. I could not find an address for this, the address to where we sent the papers did not seem to exist. They lost our details, told us they were filled in wrongly, etc etc until months had gone by. In the end they refused us the refund (too much time  had elapsed!) Then they refused our appeal. At this point Booking could step in. The woman on the phone (answered quickly, by a human being!) was lovely. She knew what to do. Booking refunded us in 24 hours.

I tell myself I should before booking and after reading reviews here for Booking.com & Hotels.com I certainly will in future. Our first problem came when we arrived at the Holiday Inn Express at Nogales, Arizona. Our party of 6 decided to check in early then go out. When we arrived we were double booked by Booking.com. Apparently they had oversold the rooms allocated to them & we were going to be bounced to a local Best Western. Not the end of the world but we decided 'Sod it, we booked the HIE & we are staying in the HIE. We were told the Booking.com should have advised us ahead of us arriving. The reception were understanding, uncomplimentary about the agent & happily found rooms for us after a bit of negotiation. We moved on from Nogales to Sierra Vista after two days & stayed at the Magnuson Hotel, rated at 8.4. How on earth it got a rating of 8.4 is anyones guess. I rated it as a 2, & my companions thought that was generous. It really was the low point of an otherwise great trip to SE Arizona. It seems both the two big 3rd party booking agents are badly rated at more than 60% cr#p. Doubt I will ever use them again. Book direct seems to be the best option going forward.",2,0,en,Bookingstar2345

27,Customer,unknown,2022-05-10T12:13:50.000Z,Website does not accurately reflect hotel facilities,"We booked a hotel In Munich through Booking.Com for a weekend break. Due to flight times and knowing the City would be very busy, we wanted a hotel that had a bar and a restaurant.   On our arrival we asked to eat in the restaurant, only to be informed that the hotel restaurant was closed and only the breakfast service was being provided.   It was obvious that this had been the case for some time as the staff seemed very embarrassed at having to tell arriving guests this.   We then went to get a drink in the hotel bar only to be told that it too was closed.  As there was no lounge for residents we had to go looking for a bar needless to say on a Friday night they were all full and we ended up having to go back to our room.   No minibar drinks except water or juice and only a nespresso machine with very limited choice.  The next day we saw happy hour in the hotel bar advertised in the lift so we planned to go, only to find that evening that the bar was in darkness again.  Staff advised that the bar was closed and had not been open for some time.  Whilst apologetic they could not offer any drinks or even a hot chocolate to guests.    Booking.com advertise this hotel as having a great restaurant and all 4 star facilities it actually was on a par with a 2 star hotel in terms of facilities available.  Booking.com clearly do not verify any of the information provided by their hotels.  This spoiled our break, as we like to have a relaxing drink in a hotel bar at the beginning and/ or end of an evening and this was not possible.

64,Paul,unknown,2022-04-08T14:05:59.000Z,I may still have to use them in the future but won't trust them,"I have used booking.com for many years both for accommodation research and making some 25 or so bookings. The majority of the bookings have been absolutely fine. In fact I have only had serious problems requiring contact with customer services for two bookings over the years and yet these experiences have left me giving such a poor trust score. How come?The first problem was in 2017 which was a last minute booking for two rooms in a hotel in Sweden. The confirmation email stated that I should pay the hotel in full on arrival. We did that. We discovered later that booking.com had also taken full payment on my credit card (at the point of booking). So I had paid twice - a simple error to resolve I thought, and yet it took 3 weeks of an absurdly extended and frustrating correspondence. The credit card company suggested that I attempt to resolve it directly first, and keep a record along the way, before they would step in. Booking.com doesn't make it easy to download chat exchanges, and I had to take screenshots to capture the evidence.The ""chat"" experience with customer services was beyond frustrating. They started off pretending not to understand the problem then they 'blamed' me suggesting that as I had booked two rooms I should expect to pay double! Then they started asking (repeatedly) for a mass of information (credit card transaction records, emails) that were either unnecessary or in their possession already. Then finally they decided it was the hotel's fault. I contacted the hotel and they arranged a credit within a couple of days and suggested I book directly with them in future.More recently (2022), I booked a hotel in London during which the advertised room rate I selected on the booking.com website was stated to include ""all taxes and charges"". Yet when I scrolled down to click the confirmation button I noticed that the price had increased by an additional ""12.5% V.A.T. (Value Added Tax)"" In my mind this must have been an error, and easily resolvable if not an error then it was clearly a deceptive or misleading advertising practice. The message exchange with customer services followed precisely the same frustrating trajectory as the earlier complaint of years before, going round in circles for weeks.  They undertook a full investigation and concluded (and I have it in writing) that there was no error with the pricing information provided to me during the booking process. Other commentators have mentioned the (lack of) reliability of hotel reviews on the site. Personally, I find the reviews much less helpful than TripAdvisor and so I don't generally read or write them any more. But I have recently written a negative but honest review for a hotel and will be watching carefully to see if it gets deleted. So, I am left with little trust or faith in this company. I no longer use it for research as there are now better alternatives. As a Genius Level 2 member, there might be times in future when booking.com is the cheapest method to book and so I won't be closing my account in a hurry. But I will be watching my credit card transactions live and reading the small print during every booking I make with them in future ... anything to avoid dealing with customer services ever again.",2,0,en,Bookingstar2345

The hosts left me dirty, wet towels! Not a single dry clean towel. No warm blankets in winter. No hot water in the bathroom! I was told it might take a while for it to get heated! There was no kitchenware in the kitchen. To top it all I was warned that there was a persistent danger of the front door lock getting jammed. It did as soon as I got inside and I was locked indoors. I had to retrieve a spare key from a safety box on the window and ended up hurting my head as a result of climbing on the window. I had booked the apartment for a medical trip. The host refused to give me my money back even though I had to sleep at alternative accommodation. The people who offer this apartment are scammers and they deliberately ask for a full prepayment upfront, so they can keep your money in exchange for a downright disgusting level of service.The customer service agent I spoke to was wonderful and extremely compassionate, but ultimately I feel ripped off.

For example, they listed a Super 8 motel for $62 a night (excluding taxes) and when I completed my booking they ended up charging me $94 a night. Even with taxes, the $62 a night room should have only come out to about $70 total. Stick to Priceline or Hotels.com.

Is ok or not then?So I decided to chat with some support agent.Their support chat is inadequate, to be nice. While I was typing it deleted text, emptying the chat box to type before being able to send it. Happened several times loosing important details of the situation, being unable or difficult to explain what is the problem. It elongated the proces quite a bit. I also had to adapt and type very quick in very short sentences not to loose what I am typing agin, mistyping a lot as a consequence. It did not really help to comprehend what I am trying to say....But that was not enough. The chat representative told me that he/she couldn't see all of my recent messages before some unspecific point in time. Really?! : ) Loosing important parts of the conversation?! How could they give help if they couldn't see customer messages properly?This customer support system they built sounds being unable to do its job.They send false message about declined card (turned out to be false after quite a bit of time wasted eventually), their chat is deleting a lot of text that I try to type before being able to send it, the representative takes tens of minutes to look up my data putting me on hold repeatedly, but even then he/she is unable to comprehend the situation becuse even the sent messages of mine are lost for them!Usually I have no trouble with bookings but this tiny glitch escalated quite a bit! They seem to get lost in their own system with false info and lost discussions, this just makes the situation more difficult instead of resolving it, defying the whole purpose of a support system.... what if I had a more serious case not just a small glitch, the thougth of relying on booking.com support when some real trouble strikes far away from home scares me.... : (",3,0,en,Bookingstar2345

164,Jamie Cardoso,unknown,2021-11-24T16:35:40.000Z,"Took a while, but got it resolved in the end, after a lot of effort and pushback","On the 09-November-2021, I have booked a return flight (for almost ¬£300), departing from London on 20-December-2021, and returning on the 10-January-2022.  It's worth noting, I have taken and submitted a screen grab depicting the dates entered on booking.com website. Subsequently, I had received an automatic email with the flight confirmation, customer reference and a pin number, with a return flight set to 20-December-2021 (same day) .After realizing booking.com made an error, I have called them immediately to change the return flight date to, 10-January-2022, as originally entered on booking.com website. While on the telephone, before I could speak or chat online with any of booking.com customer service representatives, I was asked to provide a nine-digit confirmation number, which I was never provided with.My flight reference number was, forty, hyphen, followed by nine numbers. As result, I was Not able to speak with anyone on the phone that day.However, on the same day ( 09-November-2021), after a thorough Google search, I was able to find booking.com customer service email address and contacted them. Unfortunately, my experience with them was less than pleasant. I was passed around from one customer service representative to another, asking me the exact same questions, for hours. In the end, I got nothing resolved. It's also worth noting, I've personally emailed many of their employees I had found on LinkedIn about my incident (including the CEO, Glenn Fogel). And have not heard back from any of them.On the 13-November-2021, I have managed to contact etraveligroup via telephone and email. Etraveligroup is part of booking.com, and deals with flight enquiries.  After providing a thorough account/evidence of my previous incident with booking.com, a tracking number was created for this case. And was promised to hear back from a manager as soon as possible.On the 20-November-2021, I had decided to call again. One of etraveligroup's customer service representatives(Kirti) escalated the case for me. On 23-November-2021, I have contacted etraveligroup once again, to follow up on the case, and got nowhere with a customer service rep called, Praveen.Finally, I've sent an email to etraveligroup's Chief Customer Officer (Pia Vemmelund) and included the CEO, Mathias Hedlund, and booking.com CEO (Glenn Fogel). Days later, I was contacted by etraveligroup  customer service manager to resolve the problem. After a lot of pushback from them to avoid accountability, they have finally done the honourable thing: Changed my return ticket to 10-January-2022, without charging me a penny for their mistake.

166,Philip Walker,unknown,2021-11-20T16:48:56.000Z,"Reliable travel agents, in my experience","When people have a good holiday experience they might well write a good review of the hotel - but they probably won‚Äôt give a thought to the travel agent they used. If, however, they feel the agent has let them down then they will certainly write an indignant critical review here on Trustpilot.I‚Äôve used Booking.com for years. I‚Äôve never had anything go wrong. I have, just today, had to cancel a hotel booking which I had made through Booking.com. It took seconds I logged onto my account, opened the trip details, found the Cancel button and clicked and the cancellation has been confirmed by email.Reading the reviews, the most common complaints people make of all mainstream online travel agents are 1. The hotel has no record of our booking. 2. They won‚Äôt refund my cancellation. 3. They‚Äôve taken money out of my account. 4. They‚Äôve cancelled my holiday. Main stream travel agents don‚Äôt do these things spuriously. It might help inexperienced travellers to know: 1. Hotels don‚Äôt receive guest booking lists until the cancellation deadlines have passed. 2. There are always two prices for hotels: cancellable and non-cancellable. If you book non-cancellable then no matter what your personal disaster, no agent will refund your money. That‚Äôs what travel insurance is for. 3. If you‚Äôve booked a cancellable rate and the cancellation deadline passes your card will be charged. (There was one occasion when I had forgotten a booking I made many months ahead. I suddenly noticed a charge of five hundred pounds on my card. It was a shock - but completely legitimate). 4. If a card submitted to hold a reservation is not honoured at the point payment becomes due, the booking might well be cancelled.I don‚Äôt work for the travel industry but I would always rather book through Booking.com or Expedia than book a foreign hotel direct.",5,0,en,Bookingstar2345

Booking.com state that it is easy to make changes on their website or the app. Well this is completely untrue. You can only cancel the booking completely, or change dates for both rooms. You can't change room type. The hotel was also very unhelpful as they insisted I should make the changes through booking.com, but you can't!

Booking.com say they are also having a hard time contacting the property - might be true but they as a well-established company should have a way to deal with it.)) they email from no-reply address so difficult to have an email conversation. when emailing their customer service address, you get a reply to go to their FAQs on the website. it is a jungle...if you're not price sensitive, better go direct with the providers. or just book with booking.com and take it as an experience but be ready to lower your expectations. i think i will choose to go direct from now on, just to have less hassle and to avoid middlemen.",2,1,en,Bookingstar2345

On arrival to the hotel we were given a room overlooking a construction site. We went to ask about the potential of being moved however the reception was very busy with a number of other groups asking the same query. We decided to leave it and went outdoors to the pool area, expecting a tranquil and relaxing luxury area instead we were shocked to find a huge building site inside the pool area where they were constructing a new bar/restaurant. This was not made clear when booking and is not stated on the hotel site which I think is shocking as we did look to book an alternative hotel however they had mentioned building works on their site hence why we went with dukes. We arrived home and contacted our agent booking.com immediately, some of the staff were extremely helpful and empathetic however when I say some I mean very few. As a customer service agent myself I was appalled by the way I was spoken to by the staff on the customer service line at booking.com. After several phone calls to chase up what was going on I got to a point of frustration, I asked to speak with a manager after being refused several times I stood my ground and eventually got put through to someone, a lovely guy named Juergen F. After a rocky start to the conversation his attitude seemed Asif he too could not be bothered to listen or assist with the complaint, when I queried this he then quickly apologised and we went on to have a thorough discussion.i would like to thank this guy personally as he has gone above and beyond to help us and assist in making this awful experience slightly better.

However, when we arrived at the hotel it was closed, with a note on the door which seemed to indicate it had gone bankrupt (I can only presume this was what was meant by an 'ongoing maintenance issue'). Booking.com was no help whatsoever - no reply to any of my messages. The upshot of all this is that we  had to spend a fortune on a last-minute hotel in London to replace the entirely fictitious accommodation offered by Booking.com. I am appalled.(Two days later). To add insult to injury, I see that it now says in our reservation, ""No-show: fees waived by property"". This is a blatant and outright lie. We showed up all right, in a taxi, with a considerable amount of luggage, at past ten o'clock in the evening, to find this hotel completely closed down. And still no reply from Booking.com, which appears to have turned into a scam operation.I challenge Booking.com to reply to me below denying my account of what happened.(A few days later). Another point: I spent a long time trying to find a hotel in London which has windows which open fully, because we were very anxious about Covid. The hotel we booked - but never got to stay in - fulfilled this criterion. So the fact that we then had to take a chance on any old hotel, which may or may not have had opening windows, was an additional source of stress.(19 days after the event). Booking.com has now agreed to refund me, which I am of course very pleased about. They have also apologised, which I appreciate. But this was not a good experience - and I did not like the fact that they blamed me for not contacting them, when they were the ones who quite simply ignored my message. Neither did I care for the lies the hotel told (that we were a no-show and they decided to waive the fees - that is simply untrue).

I asked booking.com to either make the initial property cover the costa or to give me a PROOF that the closure is for covid reasons and was necessary, but they refused to do either saying covid is unpredictable (oh and I asked booking means I wrote few emails to which no one responded and called them after). Covid is unpredictable but not so much after 1.5 years. I would have been absolutely the same if I booked with the hotel directly rather then through booking.com. Absolutely horrible experience and staff which do not know how you can put in a formal complaint and which can not provide you with the proof that the property really closes for covid reasons!

We assumed because we were asking about wheelchair accessibility that it was therefore accessible but there were in fact 2 approximately 7 inch steps to go up to get into the room. Luckily the hotel staff was amazing, extremely helpful and we were given an upgrade to a room that would be easier to get into, and we carry a ramp with us, in case of these emergencies so we were able to get the chair into the room.Booking.com needs to make wheelchair accessibility as clear as other things,  such as how many beds and towels there are.  20% of the American population are disabled folks.It looks like many of the hotels advertised on Booking.com are not ADA compliant.

I booked an apartment in Leeds and had to cancel for Covid-related reasons.  The host said 'fine, you have credit for another date' but recorded it on Booking.com's system as a 'no-show'. When the other date came, they texted the day before to say the apartment wasn't available because someone there had tested positive and that I would get a refund.  No refund.  The apartment I booked instead was not as described on the site (not enough beds for all of us) and was not clean, no one came to let us in, and the key fob to the building did not work so that if we went out we would not be able to get back in.  I started trying to clean the place, but decided we couldn't stay when I found the fridge full of food. I was promised a refund, but the money has not been refunded.  Booking.com told me on the phone, 'you can't be scammed if you book through us', but I have lost money for two bookings and wasted so much time and effort trying to contact them.  There has been no reply to my messages and the 'contact customer services' link just says to contact the host ie. the person who has scammed me.  That's not a service, that's an abdication of responsibility. I thought they might care about their reputation and want customers to trust them, but on the basis of my most recent experience, that is not so.An update: Booking.com refunded in full for the first booking after I opened a PayPal case.  The host of the second booking finally refunded me after a follow up call from Booking.com - so in the end I didn't lose money.

So far I seem to have been lucky. Earlier this year, I booked a short break for last week, in this country. I can honestly say, it was the most horrible booking experience I have ever had. As the hotel was very nice, I have given 2 stars rather than 1.When I first booked, 4 months ago, I was asked  to notify our arrival time, which I did, via booking.com, and got an acknowledgement. Six minutes later, I was again asked to notify our time of arrival. Below that was a list of behaviour that would not be tolerated - breakages, excessive noise etc.20 minutes later, the same message was repeated with a different check-in time, followed by a long piece about detailed terms of  booking.com and eviivo. Unbelievably, the whole message was then repeated in the same email!! Then the whole lot came again 4 days before our arrival, again asking for arrival time and again repeating the admonitions about bad behaviour.We arrived, paid our bill and got a receipt.

297,Ret32,unknown,2021-06-23T16:16:25.000Z,Use with caution - business website rubbish,"Business website for booking very frustrating, no ability to get invoices, poorly laid out, keeps telling me I've signed out when I haven't, loads of useless information I don't need yet lacking in basic info. Hard to navigate. Difficult to resolve any issues as you can't speak to anyone. Hotels never email invoices despite always requesting this info via Booking.com, even when you pay via Booking.com you would think Booking.com would be the ones to issue an invoice. No quality control/checks on hotels that are listed, you could list a box in your back garden and Booking.com would allow. Very hit and miss. If you know the hotel already you can sometimes get some good deals but would never risk an unknown hotel on here as some are very poor ones. Quality of info varies between different listings. Never really sure what type of room you are going to get as what is pictured isn't always what you get where hotels have more than one available - this should be clearer. If you can book a certain room via number or name if you use hotels website you should be able to do the same with Booking.com It's a pity they don't just concentrate on quality hotels/B&Bs etc whether budget or luxury, rather than any rubbish and listings that are already on AB&B. It doesn't give you much confidence in booking what looks like a nice hotel when there is so much poor quality accommodation on site as well. Nothing wrong with budget accommodation sometimes but it still needs to be of a clean and reasonable standard.",2,0,en,Bookingstar2345

Pre COVID I had no issues with dealing with booking.com for hotel accommodations. However recently I used them to book a flight for a business matter. So time and availability of flights was extremely essential. Hours after booking the flight the airline changed departure time, and cancelled all other flights for several days. The change in departure time and not having any other flights to choose from made it impossible for me to use them for my flight needs. I requested a refund the same day as the booking through booking.com customer service. After waiting over a week I received an email from booking.com and their affiliate Go to Gate, telling me that I would have to pay a cancellation fee to the airline and booking.com, for what? If flight changes and cancellations don't matter to your travel plans then use booking.com but if consistency, transparency and excellent customer service matters then stay far away from booking.com. By the way, they have over 850 Better Business Bureau complaints...those are only the folks that filed a complaint.Update 8/26: Shortly after posting this review, and filing a complaint with the BBB I received a full refund of my ticket price.

This is easily done through your Booking.com account with the 'Contact property' option. Depending on the property you should expect a response within 24 hours. Every booking I've made with Booking.com has worked out perfectly (and I've made many!) So I don't understand the negative comments here. Rates are always competitive and I find the reviews of the properties really helpful when making a choice. The map option is also great. I've used Hotels.com and Trivago but in my opinion, Booking.com is much better and easier to use than these.",5,0,en,Bookingstar2345

Today 10th February2021 after chasing my Bank discovered I was paid by the Hotel ¬£617.86.  A deduction of ¬£30.14 was made for Exchange rate.  Normally Hotels DO NOT CHARGE the Card until you arrive at the Hotel and the Visa Card is given to Guarantee Booking.  To my disappointment I was charged by the Hotel 8 Months before my arrival.  I rang Booking.com and spoke to Ian at Customer Services.  My questions were not answered which were as follows:-1.  WHY THE HOTEL CHARGED MY VISA CARD 8 MONTHS BEFORE ARRIVAL DURING PANDAMIC AS ANYTHING COULD HAVE HAPPENED?2.  IT WAS FREE CANCELLATION SO I EXPECT TO BE REFUNDED FULL AMOUNT?3.  WHEN I MADE THE BOOKING IT SAID CLEARLY ""YOU CAN CANCEL LATER, SO LOCK IN THE PRICE TODAY"" which I did?Bearing the above I did NOT get anywhere with Booking.com and when I asked to speak to The Manager.  Manager NEVER came on the phone.  I said to Ian from Booking.com to get the Manager to call me either on my Mobile No. or my Home phone No.  So far NO ONE CALLED ME FROM BOOKING.COM!!!!I have travelled the world and I have NEVER HAD ANY HOTEL CHARGE ME 8 MONTHS BEFORE ARRIVAL!!!!!!  Had I known the Hotel was going to charge me, I would have NEVER BOOKED PENHA LONGA RESORT.  I know Hotels are going through rough times, but that does not mean they can betray Customer Trust.  Also had I known the Hotel was going to charge me 8 months before arrival, I would have NEVER MADE THIS BOOKING AS WE ARE IN OUR 70s AND ALSO DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY OF COVID CAN'T COMIT TO ANYTHING.I was told that this was due to Exchange Rate.  Why have I been put into this Dilema.  Booking.com blamed Exchange Rate which I clearly asked why I was charged.

I had hoped a short break over the long Easter weekend  with our children and dog would cheer us all up. I choose to stay in my own country in the UK hoping this would increase the chances of it being a permissible travel option by then . I choose a staycation with a good free cancel option on booking.com as a safer bet. I have been a loyal  customer with booking.com for many years. I looked all over Wales for hrs until I found a lovely suitable place.A week after booking I messaged the owners was assured I could bring  our dog and accepted the extra charges.Then today - over a month after my booking I get a short ( cowardly) email communication from the owners that they have double booked and so now had 2 options - cancel my original booking on booking.com  or change my dates. ( I choice Easter intentionally so we had time off work to allow the long weekend travel )( I suspected they have since offered it elsewhere at a higher price as the media  this week - is full of how this might be the first weekend staycations open up) I wrote to booking.com and they really didnt care or comment on my questions re how or why had this happened so long  after my booking and instead suggested an alternative that wasn‚Äôt even dog friendly- i wrote explaining this and again asked how had this happened and for assurances this would not happen again - reply - again they ignored this question and an alternative rental suggested this time was dog friendly but so unlike the one I had booked it  just frustrated me further ( the first ones rental heading was ‚Äústunning countryside view with hot tub ‚Äú this alternative had no view at all and no hot tub.I know its been a terrible year for the travel industry but this hardly builds  confidence in staycations or this booking site in my view.,2,2,en,Bookingstar2345

Unfortunately, they have let me down one too many times and I cannot justify using them again.I could write an essay on why I do not recommend them but I‚Äôll try to keep it brief.‚Ä¢ When things go wrong, their customer service is woefully inadequate. It is entirely outsourced to a separate agency (presumably based in India) whose staff have no authority to do anything and seem to exist solely to fob you off. You will never, ever be able to contact anybody who works for booking.com directly.‚Ä¢ Their review and rating system is rigged. Certain establishments are immune from negative reviews and will always be amongst Booking.com‚Äôs highest recommended options regardless of what their genuine customer satisfaction rating should be.‚Ä¢ A hotel that anticipates a negative review can effectively block it by marking you down as a no-show. No amount of complaining to Booking.com will get your review published, even if you provide proof of your stay.‚Ä¢ I once had a hotel cancel my reservation on the night of my stay. I tried to check in at 6pm and had been told my room wasn't ready. Three hours later, I received a text message saying my reservation had been cancelled. They had already taken payment weeks in advance, but I was left stranded at 9pm in winter conditions with nowhere to go. Booking.com refused to publish my negative review because I hadn‚Äôt actually stayed there. I had to file a credit card chargeback to get my money returned.Some people will tell you to always book directly with a hotel to get the best price.

The next day I happened to sign into my Booking.com account, only to see that the booking had been cancelled. I had not received any contact from Booking.com to let me know of the cancellation, it was just lucky I had signed into my account and saw it. I checked my credit card, but everything was fine there. I tried to rebook the property online, but no joy, so I called Booking.com myself. After the staff put me on hold for about 20 minutes, they told me the system had automatically cancelled my booking. They didn't know why, but thought it might have had something to do with my booking history. Not too sure what that means as I haven't had issues with bookings in the past. I asked if they would help me rebook there on the phone. No, they couldn't do that. They could only suggest that I try to rebook using a different account. Strange thing to suggest... I explained what a disappointment this experience was and what a disaster it would have been if I had shown up at the property without a booking, since I had not been made aware of the cancellation. All I got was a ""We're sorry, there's nothing we can do"". I asked for a discount voucher to make up for the mess and stress their ""automatic system"" had caused. Again, ""No, we're sorry, nothing we can do."" This system of theirs caused quite a problem - which could have ballooned into a much bigger problem had I not been dilligent - and they've just left me to clean up the mess. Booking.com has taken no responsibility to rectify the problem and, frankly, I'm appalled.My advice to you, make damn sure your booking is actually booked, and check on it each day in case they randomly cancel it.

Content isn't appropriately arranged and makes it hard to find information about the property. I booked a stay and the room was different from the pictures. Pictures should be uploaded for each room or property type. There is only one main set of photos, which may not be what you are reserving.4. When I make a selection on the filters, the website refreshes starting you back to the top of the page again. Super annoying.5. I wish they provided more information about the hosts or property owners. A lot of properties I skip because there isn't any information listed about the host because I want to know who I am renting from for private properties. I only book with brand names because of that. 6. Another pain making a reservation through Booking.com is some guest requirements are missing.

More websites should offer this as it becomes very difficult to book rooms during busy periods when you wait and see if you can get it off work etc.Most of my experiences with rooms from booking.com have gone very smoothly. No issues, which is why I gave four stars.BUT I did have one very horrific experience. Me, my sister and our friends went to London for a concert. My sister booked the hotel way in advance. When we turn up on the day, we‚Äôre told our room has been double booked. We had no warning, we were in a big city with nowhere to go and all hotels were booked up as it was a popular concert, and we were not offered a nearby alternative like other hotels might. The managers were not there so we had to call them on the phone. When  my sister got upset (not swearing or being rude, just crying and shouting hysterically as we realised we were three young girls stranded), he swore and threatened to call the police if we didn‚Äôt leave (we‚Äôd arrived at our room before the other people). As we‚Äôd planned to charge our phones, they died. We were excited to get ready to see our favourite band but we had to go unshowered and upset. When the concert ended, we walked for a couple of hours stopping at every hotel we could find, willing to pay any price, but they had no rooms. We almost surrendered to sleeping on a park bench until my sister remembered her friend that lived in the city. However, our phones were dead so we had to charge them in a subway, and it took another hour to get a taxi.My first issue with booking.com is they should check the quality and legitimacy of the places they list. We had just come from a couple of hours away, but I know some people had flown into this concert from Scandinavia. We knew someone here, but what if they didn‚Äôt? Secondly, we had to pay ¬£30 to store our bags at the venue and around ¬£70 for the Uber. Booking.com customer service at first told us they would refund us for the room but was insistent they would cover nothing else. We called again and another agent said of course they would also cover the extra costs that we wouldn‚Äôt have had to pay if our hotel had not cancelled. This is much better, but honestly we should‚Äôve been compensated.",4,0,en,Bookingstar2345

I booked a hotel 4 months away choosing  the free cancellation, pay on arrival but then had a pending transaction flare up on my bank account, which I was unprepared for.

Apparently it's specified in the front end page of the property, when the room is selected, or in the confirmation email under ""prepayment"". I obviously never read it and it's a routine to verify the card is valid, not lost or stolen. But I have been a customer of booking.com for quite a while and my card details are on file. The property can pre-authorise any amount, and in my case around 30% of the booking but this amount will be returned.

I then thought I would visit the section for Booking.com to leave a positive review, as I appreciate we are often quick to complain but rarely compliment when someone does something well.

Yes the CS advisors are courteous and do their best, but booking.com has NO INTEREST in getting refunds for customers at this present time. We had a 4 night hotel reservation booked and paid for in London for last week and neither the property nor Booking.com were prepared to refund our money, eventhough the property website clearly stated ‚ÄûEssential workers only can stay, all other reservations will be cancelled‚Äú! It wasn‚Äòt until I told the property that we would be driving to the UK to take our holiday and will they confirm our reservation is current that they finally agreed to refund our money in full!!  This is quite simply shocking behaviour and not the way we should be treating people at such a difficult time!! We too have lost business and will definitely do so this summer and no doubt next winter, however that does not mean ‚Äûshaft customers!‚Äú My advice to people who are having problems with accommodation refunds is to please be sure to cancel your reservation with an email sent through the booking.com system to the accommodation stating that you are cancelling and giving your travel problem reasons and not ‚Äúno showing‚Äù as this will give you the right of recourse further down the line.

However, woe betide you if there is a problem between you and the hotel - they are no where in sight. They love to take their booking fee then simply wash-their-hands of any involvement in 'difficult' situations leaving you to thrash it out with the hotel. Trying to phone them is impossible - I have more chance speaking to Lord Lucan (Brits of a certain age will know this name!). Also, if you book several rooms for a group this is achievable (actually encouraged) on the site. However, if the hotel has different T&Cs for groups there is no way of knowing this until the hotel takes action - ordinarily taking the entire booking amount even if you ticked the boxes to pay upon departure and only use the reserving credit card for a minimal test payment to prove that it is valid. When you have booked several hotels this is a VERY unwelcome surprise. All told Booking.com are not keeping up with modern developments in the market, their infrastructure and service are very 2010, not 2020.

That money has not been returned to me.  I managed to shake the tree about a reservation in York, and evidently the hotel there contacted booking.com and I will get my money in 7 to 10 days.  The last reservation...I had a nice talk with the owner.  Evidently she receives no money until I arrive.  Booking.com has closed their phones to calls due to heavy volume.  They haven't created a call back possibility.  No wait time is allowed.  No queue.  No message other than the call will be ended shortly.Who is holding your money?  Look at your credit card.

As the cancellation policy seems to prevent me from simply amending the date of my trip, I had hoped to speak to a representative, explain the extenuating circumstances, and rely on their common sense and empathy, to enable me to transfer the dates of my booking from March to June. I have spent around 45 minutes holding, over 2 separate calls, both of which were terminated after an automated message told me that booking.com were ""experiencing difficulties"". I sent an email through the website. The response I received directed me back to the website. There is no live chat available anywhere and it seems impossible to get any meaningful contact with anyone from this website. I get that given the current worldwide pandemic, it is going to be hard for sites such as this to provide the best customer service. But MAKE PROVISION! Enable users to amend bookings because of this virus, and give us some leeway because of these unforeseen circumstances.i personally will be boycotting this service, and advising everyone I come into contact with to do the same, until booking.com show signs of improving this shocking level of service.EDIT: Booking,com contacted me to say that due to the circumstances they would change the dates of my booking at no extra cost. I do feel they have redeemed themselves through this act of mercy. It does not change the initial frustration I felt when trying to sort this out, however they were probably quite overwhelmed with people in the same situation.

629,Aaron Green,unknown,2020-02-20T12:06:58.000Z,BAD COMPLAINTS HANDLING PRACTICES - POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I recently had my firs very poor experience with Booking.com and have been left out of pocket because of their bad complaints handling practices.I booked a reservation with Tartan Lodge in Glasgow from a Thursday to Sunday and requested check in for 6am Friday morning. I was told by telephone reception that this would be fine that a note would be added to the system to allow for this. However, when I arrived at Tartan Lodge, there was noone available in reception. I waited 30 minutes for someone to come to the reception desk and tried to check in. I was then told by the staff member that I would have to pay extra money to check in due yo the time of arrival. Even after I explained the arrangement made with the telephone staff the day before and the fact that I had paid for the previous night also, the staff member insisted on receiving extra payment. When I refused to pay extra fees, the staff member told me I need to leave and walked off leaving me in the reception area. As a result, I had nowhere to stay after working a night shift and was not able to arrange alternative accommodation until later that afternoon. Since raising this complaint with Tartan Lodge I received no response at all and Booking.com have stated that they are unable to compensate me due to having no response from Tartan Lodge in relation to the specific complaint points made. I escalated my complaint to a manager at Booking.com who told me that I ""dont have a complaint point"" because Tartan Lodge had no confirmed what happened. I explained to the manager at Booking.com that a customer can have a valid complaint point regardless of whether the other party has responded to it. In fact, as a customer service focused platform, Booking.com should be treating customers fairly by ensuring that their accomodation partners such as Tartan Lodge are held to account. Failing a response from the accommodation partner, Booking.com should have resolved the complaint and compensated me as the customer if they truly put their customer's first. In the end, the Booking.com manager simply stated that she was making a ""business decision"" to reject my complaint and would not take it further! This was despite the fact that I had 1. Not received a response to my initial complaint raised with Booking.com and the accommodation partner, 2. Chased Booking.com for updates on my complaint over a period of 3 weeks, 3. Repeating my complaint issue multiple times because Booking.com failed to record accurately the complaint issues being raised, 4. Not had any compensation for being without a place to stay on the morning of the issue or for related costs of travel and arranging alternative accommodation.Overall this was by far the worst experience I have had with any accommodation booked through Booking.com. I've used the service many times and continue to do so out of convenience, but it is disappointing that when it comes to a complaint being raised Booking.com demonstrates very poor practices and a lack of care for the customer experience. Clearly Booking.com are only concerned with earnings from accomodation partners as oppose to those ultimately giving the company its earnings, the customer!",2,0,en,Bookingstar2345

Although it's usually cheaper to book directly through the accommodation itself, it's easier to use just one website for all bookings when travelling around. However, I recently had a bad experience with a hotel and left a bad review, which was held back without notifying me. I'm not sure of the reason, the website only says ""This review has been hidden because it doesn't meet our guidelines"" (probably either the fact that I mentioned the accommodation provided me with an Uber chauffeur, which is illegal in that part of the world, or my use of the word '@sshole' in the context of ""there were children sleeping and because I'm not an @sshole, I kept quiet""). I'm mostly displeased with the fact that Booking censors reviews without notifying the people who left them. I would've liked to have been given the opportunity to censor the word '@sshole', if that was indeed the reason (I'm not sorry about the comment on the Uber, it was the truth). It also makes me wonder if this is how this particular accommodation (and possibly others) has such good reviews?Also, I tried 4 times to call Booking to complain but I don't think there's actually any person behind their customer service phone number.

663,Vfx Traveller,unknown,2020-01-19T13:03:16.000Z,Wrong advertising,"I emailed to booking.com about a hotel as I wanted to give them a review but they replied to me that I cannot give a review because I didn't stay in the Green Field Resort. They should check that the hotels are advertising the same hotel where they put the customers in the end. You cannot put nice pictures on the web page of the hotel in booking.com if the hotel in the end is something totally different. This was my review about the hotel:Be careful when you book yourself a room at Green Field Resort Ubud.I was travelling in Bali and wanted to return to Ubud and stay in a nice hotel. I checked the pictures from Green field resort (booking.com) and it looked like one where I would like to stay. It was a close walk from many places, there were nice pools and a restaurant.I arrived to the hotel late and it was dark already. The hotel staff told me they will drive me to my room. I was only looking forward to go to bed as I had travelled all day. When I woke up in the morning I realised that I wasn't in the same hotel or even close to it. It only had a small pool and there was some construction work next to it. There was no restaurant and hardly any people either. I thought I had been scammed.I went to talk about the hotel with the staff and they were understandable and they let me know they can drive me to places if I need to, as the hotel was further away from the main areas of Ubud. They also told me I could use the pool of the other hotel that I had originally booked. I thought I'll try how it worked and stayed. The problems araised as I went to use the pool of the hotel I had originally booked. I went to have some food as well and I later on heard I'm not allowed to use the pool and their services as I wasn't a customer there. How embarrassing. So I left and went back to my hotel. There were problems with the transport as well. I wanted to get a lift to a certain place and they said there's so much traffic and that it's faster to walk (in the heat). So the original plan of me getting transports wasn't true and available. In the end I decided I wanted to change the hotel. This was a scam from the start! The hotel cannot just move people to another hotel in case they don't have enough space and take you to another one you didn't book in the first place. Just be careful when you deal with the hotels in these areas.",2,0,en,Bookingstar2345

The position is really fine, since it's really close to the city centre and the railway station.Everything was very good. I also had the luck of an unforeseen upgrade.

704,Sylvie Barets,unknown,2019-12-12T17:15:09.000Z,VERY DISAPPOINTED AND ANGRY.. but after 5 weeks issue was resolved,"I posted an update on 3 Jan 2020 after initial review in Dec. I have been using booking.com for many years and was a genius member and overall things have been ok. But lately I have found that they are not as professional as before and recently I had a very bad experience which will probably make me never to use booking.com again. I will tell you the story now...Over the past 2 weeks I have been fighting with booking.com and the hotel to get reimbursed. To no avail. Here is what happened: through booking.com, I booked a hotel for one night for 28 Nov, 2 twin beds. For my friend and I in Laguna Beach, California.It was a ‚Äòbooking basic‚Äô, not refundable, not changeable booking. I also noticed that I can't do a review for this hotel on booking.com!! stupid reallyBooking.com debited my account. We checked in a the hotel on 28 Nov night, and we went to bed and about 1 hour later I was woken up by my friend, she had found bedbugs, we looked in more closely and in the 2 beds there were quite a few bedbugs. We immediately packed and went to reception, the gentleman at reception suggested to take the room next door, not even bothered to come and check the room. We declined and confirmed with him that we wanted a refund, he said ok, no problem and to call again in the morning, that the hotel will do it. We left the hotel and drove back home at night. The next day I called and the hotel staff  told me that because I booked through a website I had to contact the website to arrange refund and that when the website would reach out to hotel to confirm for the reimbursement, they would confirm and approve for refund. I was shocked as the lady from hotel also acknowledged that there were bedbugs in room 201 (we were in room 203) but did not think they had spread!! I told her that my booking was not refundable and that the hotel needed to pay me directly. She told me that she cannot reimburse me as she did not yet received the money from Agoda.. I was surprised why she mentioned Agoda but said that they deal with Agoda only and not booking.com. I said I would contact booking.com and come back to her. I contacted booking.com and they said that as it was a booking basic reservation they cannot do anything and cannot process any refund and that the hotel needs to reimburse me directly. I called the hotel again but they insisted that they did not yet receive the money from the hotel website so could not do anything. At this stage I was already furious. I then called Agoda but they told me that as I made the booking through booking.com they cannot help me and will not help me. It kept on going like this for 10 days. I again called the hotel on 10 Dec and they said that they refunded Agoda so now Agoda needs to pay me!!! I called Agoda and again they said that all my queries need to go to booking.com. I called again booking.com and lodged a dispute resolution, and their response is that as it is a non refundable booking and in their systems everything shows ok, there is nothing they can do and that only the hotel can do something and that they would try to send the hotel an email. It seems the hotel does not want to accept its responsibility and only says .. 'we sent the money back to Agoda this is no longer our problem.. It is Agoda‚Äôs problem' We left  the hotel because of bedbugs not because we did not show up or try to cancel the booking.  This is crazy and in the end I am left with my money gone and 10 bedbugs bite. AWFUL EXPERIENCE !NOTA BENE EDIT TO MY INITIAL POSTAfter many more emails and phone calls with Agoda, booking.com and the hotel and more than 5 weeks after, I finally got the refund for the hotel reservation. In the end it ends well but it was a real fight to get there. It restored my confidence in Booking.com and how they are able to listen to customers concern and respond appropriately. The bed bugs bites have also disappeared....",4,0,en,Bookingstar2345

I have, however used booking.com extensively for hotels over the last few years, both on non-refundable and book now pay later basis. I have never had an issue (touch wood), plus I like that one can at least through online service contact the hotel, and pose questions and special requests. They always respond. Few months ago I downloaded their app, it also makes managing bookings a breeze. Their new feature where if you book a hotel or a city, it gives you an option to extend your stay to nearby cities, is also fun, something other online hotel booking services don't do. They price match, I experienced that, so if you book well ahead, and find same room cheaper later at some other site, they will make it the same.

Our flight to Columbo airport was on the 22nd, the morning of the day after the terrorist bombings that struck the city. We immediately called the airline to cancel our flights and there were no questions asked. Immediate refund with no charge. We then called booking.com and they said they would inform the hotel. To cut a long story short, emails and messages back and forth to the Manager and the outcome was they were not willing to refund us, even though the arrival airport city was in complete chaos and the Foreign Office had advised no traveling to Sri Lanka. After much discussion the hotel said they could give us a holiday voucher to use within one year. Booking.com told them that would not be acceptable as we would obviously be taking another vacation and use our vacation budget on that! it was quite unbelievable that the hotel was insisting that they would not refund us after the bombings. Booking.com called me a few times and they were so helpful, I was actually overwhelmed by their total empathy towards us and wish I could remember the names of the staff members who called me. Anyway...long short of it, Booking.com refunded us in full and with no cancelation charge, so we did not lose one penny! Thank you so much booking.com for relieving our anxiety and being so helpful and understanding of the whole horrific situation.

So...they don't look after the guest either!!  And they CERTAINLY don't look after us, as an accommodation provider.  Won't go into a long winded story and will keep this brief.  They have a huge monopoly over search engines such as Google, they can afford to pay vast sums of money to be the first to come up on the landing pages of Google, Yahoo etc so the small establishment does not stand a chance. They use your listing to list with various companies so the independents have no control over the content.  They won't let us list our properties how we want them, they are described in `corporate' style which is not an accurate way to list the establishments who list with them.They have affiliate partners such as Agoda and TripAdvisor and heaven help you dealing with Agoda (Tripadvisor have actually always been really helpful).  Agoda `pulled' our information off booking.com and despite the fact that our booking.com listing says we do not allow children or extra beds in any of our rooms, the Agoda listing says all children welcome!!  Various automated emails to both booking.com and Agoda with the same old nonsense and no-one getting back to us to rectify a simple sentence.  We have NO control over our own business listing.  It is truly appalling way to treat accommodation providers who are their customers!We have also had numerous battles with them regarding letting guests request check-ins outside our hours on reservation (pull down list allows this) - there is a reason why we stipulate the hours we do.  No end of hassle having to get in touch with the guest and explaining this, it is not fair to the guest or us.As many people have reviewed on here - do not deal with them or any of the on-line travel agencies, they charge us 15% + commission on every single nights bookings.  If you want hassle-free booking, then deal with the accommodation direct!!  Speak to the organ grinder as opposed to the monkey!

At times I had made non-refundable bookings but circumstances led to cancellation and they were every bit understanding and refunded wherever they could. I have also always found their descriptions accurate and highly predictable. They know their hotels well whether it is a small town in Pakistan or London -Paris - Kuala Lumpur. I see that there are quite a few people who are disappointed--my advice would be to review the hotel that you select carefully--stick to 7.5+ or better 8.0+ category, do not rely on the pictures too much, check out the small print on taxes (sometimes they are excluded from the price) and always communicate with the hotel as soon as you feel you need some clarification.

Customer service and hospitality sadly lacking, staff very busy, being busy but do not go out of their way to ask if you need or require any thing else. I should add that we are British and would have expected overseas visitors to be looked after better, it would appear that this is an Italian Hotel for Italians. What a palava the procurement of the sunbeds was, we had booked two sunbeds and a sun canopy for 5 days at a cost of 40 euros per day by email prior to our arrival, assured that it would be no problem, however, whilst asking for 2 towels and the route to access the sunbeds we were Informed that it was 'not possible' if we were not given a receipt upon check in and that was quite simply that. Not what you expect to hear given the fact that there is no swimming pool, the terrace to our room was tiny with no loungers and the public beach is non existent. Getting the reception staff to understand that we had communicated previously via email to confirm wa' trying' to say the least, they were very dismissive and not helpful. Eventually the penny dropped and another reception lady who actually bothered to check the emails saved the day.

But having recently stayed at an awful place that looked good on Booking.com's website, I have learned a number of things. 1. You cannot contact Booking.com to report anything as a guest of accommodations. They're not interested in customer service and speaking to you - only in the commission they make from accommodations. 2. If you take and send bad photos of an accommodation, they don't publish them - so you don't get a real visual of where you might stay. Don't believe all the 'nice' photos. 3. They push positive reviews up so if you book in haste - you think you're booking somewhere good, 4. Do read lots of reviews of a place. If someone says it's bad - it probably is. 5. Refund?

843,Jeff Engel,unknown,2019-07-05T13:51:54.000Z,Booking.com will not help you if you're in a jam.,"We booked a property in Barcelona, Spain through Booking.com. Two days before our departure, Booking.com called to tell us the property owner cancelled our reservation. (Wait, what? They can do that?) They presented another property to us that they said was ""comparable"". We didn't know any better because we were unfamiliar with Barcelona, and it was such short notice, we didn't feel we had any choice but to trust Booking.com and accept their suggestion. So they booked the new place for us. Once we had a chance to review the new place and research options, we discovered that, yes, the new place was similar in size, beds and price, but it was WAY farther away from the location we were in originally. So, in Booking.com's eyes, replacing a property in Manhattan with one in the Bronx is totally ""comparable"". When we called back to change it to another we found that was actually more comparable, Booking.com said it was such short notice that we couldn't cancel or it would be non-refundable. So, beware, number 1, your property owner can cancel on you and, number 2, Booking.com won't do a thing to actually help you. They will simply do whatever it takes to keep a booking. They are simply a middle-man for bookings and take no responsibility for their property owners and push all risk onto the consumer. Most of the properties on Booking.com can be booked other ways and we'll never use Booking.com again.",2,0,en,Bookingstar2345

I'd already trying repeatedly calling the properties phone number with no response.When I got through to an advisor they had to check with the property, and obviously couldn't get through.  So they said they would send an email and if nothing heard in 30 mins they would ring me back.  After 40 mins nothing heard so I called them again (was on hold again for 5-10 mins).The person I spoke to said OK, they would find us alternative accommodation and that the previous person should have called back, don't know why they hadn't.  The woman I spoke to on the phone said she would personally look at alternative accommodation and email me with some options and call me back. 30 mins later I'd heard nothing at all, despite he assurance she would!My wife called the next time and said to the advisor that we wanted some new accommodation booked while on the phone.

Luckily, once we had reached Locarno I found common ground with French so the Italian speaking owner could direct me on the phone until I found the correct address. Imagine if we did not speak some French. She was apologetic and said she had several times contacted booking.com to correct the inaccuracies but they had not done so. At the end of my stay, booking.com sent me a link to review the accomodation. There were two separate text boxes to fill, one for what was most liked and one for what was least liked. They then published only the ""most liked"" feedback next to the advert for the same accomodation.

You need a PC/laptop to update the calendar in any usable fashion.

Totally opposite, a nice person called Ben replied promptly, and he contacted the host asking for a cancellation (even if the reservation didn't admit cancellations). The host agreed (I'm leaving a nice review for them as well) and then I immediately booked with the right card, and problem solved!

However, transaction are generally made in Euros which means the sum you think you are paying, or that was advertised to you as paying in your home currency, isn't necessarily what you will end up paying (and this isn't made clear).However, recently I received an offer in the post. Book a ¬£175+ trip and receive a ¬£45 refund. By luck, I was considering a few days away anyway, so we chose a hotel we'd previously stay at, advertised just above the ¬£175. We took the trip and came home and after 2 weeks still hadn't had the refund. So, I raised a ticket via their system. I didn't get a response. So, after another 5 days I called them. They claimed my trip actually cost ¬£166, below the ¬£175 threshold. But, that wasn't the price that the trip was sold to me at, and it's their inter-currency transaction that forced me below the rate they stated I'd pay, which in turn meant the refund, which was greater than the discounted rate, wouldn't be paid.In fairness, they said they'd refund this as 'a goodwill gesture', but the call operator was a bit thick and couldn't comprehend how exchange rates or currencies worked and my frustration wan't understood.

There were many occasions when supervisors had to be called as a result of ordering issues and you would think that there would be no further issues, but I'm afraid not and it was as if the chefs did not care for the guests satisfaction.

957,Claudia Ana,unknown,2019-01-20T17:03:39.000Z,Customer service just don't care,"I usually book my accommodations using Booking.com, and everything is ok, except this one time.Before Christmas 2018, I was with my husband on an ""Eurotrip"", visiting the most beautiful Christmas markets Europe has to offer (11 nights in 11 different cities).I have booked everything with almost 2 months in advance to take advantage of smaller prices.All the trip went very well, until we have reached Vienna, and this is where the fun part begins.Usually we pay our bookings by cash, but there are properties that have different policies, and pre authorize the credit card before.The property in Vienna - Steiner Residences Vienna Augarten - tried to pre authorise my credit card about a week before the date of or stay in Vienna (when we were already half way in our trip), but they were unsuccessful because I didn't had any funds left(due to christmas shopping). We sent them a message explaining the situation and they said is ok, we will pay by cash on our arrival, the only thing that was important was to inform them about our time of arrival.And so we did, we announced them our exact time of arrival, using Google Maps estimations (we traveled by car), and just with 2 hours before we entered Vienna they told us no one will be there at that time to collect our money (16:00) and that we need to pay by card (online) before check in if we want the acces codes to the building. We told them that we don't have money on the credit card, and it was the only card available, and asked if we can pay later, or if anyone can come later that day to collect the money, or maybe we can give the money to someone else.They said the it is our fault that we didn't complied to the rules (even if we discussed about thins previously through the message platform provided by booking) and now we can't check in.I must say that in the last 4 years since I used booking, this situation never happened.We panicked a little, we were on the highway, it was already dark,  and since the property did not provided any solution we thaught the only thing to do was to cancel and try to find another place to stay. The property didn't replyed ay further after that.Arround 18:00 we managed to find another booking, but when we arrived there they told us that the parking was full, and one hour later we managed to find another hotel, also through Booking.com, more expensive that the first one, but we were happy we could find anything.We were not upset about the entire situation, we only wanted to enjoy the rest of the trip, so we forgot about it by the time we came back home.The unpleasant situation happened on 14 january 2019, when my credit card was charged by Steiner Residences Vienna Augarten, for the full amount of the booking. I tryed to talk to them asking why they did that and they sayd they were protected by their cancelation policy.I submitted a complaint to booking customer service, providing the entire conversation between me and the property, and they simply agreed to the same coclusion, that they have a cancellation policy and I have to pay.If it was my fault, I would not have been so filled with frustration, but the property not only put us in a dificult situation by making us find another accomodation on the last minute, but they also charged us for canceling, even if they made it impossible for us to be able to check-in.I am just wandering, who is protecting the customers in this kind of situations since booking.com didn't even bother to read the conversations I have sent them.",2,0,en,Bookingstar2345

I also expected that they would force the owner to change his description.The description is still up there on the web.  ""Nice apartment in the heart of the Upper East Side"".

Incorrect guest details. Booking.com has somehow managed to variously send the incorrect email, passport details, nationality, credit card information for my bookings  to hotels, leading to a great deal of confusion at checkin. This is a real.breach of privacy for the people whose details were mixed up with my booking,  as well as extremely unprofessional and  inconvenient on the part of Booking.com.3. Defaulting from single person to 2-adult booking: this is particularly annoying in countries where pricing is per head.rather than per.room. Some smaller hotels got quite angry when I turned up alone, so in the end I had to resort to emailing the hotels AFTER making the booking, to.ensure they knew this.was actually one adult booking, as Booking.com consistently defaulted my booking to '2 adults.It is a pity that the quality of this site has deteriorated so much.

I would use them again. The refund process on the difference could be easier that is why I have knocked 1 star off but other than that all past experiences have been good.",4,0,en,Bookingstar2345

When trips work out ok, there isn't a problem. However, when there are issues, their customer service is extremely poor. I went on a trip to France in July and had several bookings. Unfortunately one of them was awful. I was offered a tiny bed in a tiny room with no windows. There was very little floor space so I declined to stay. In fact when I returned the key the family were smoking in the hotel too. I booked somewhere else with Booking.com then applied for a refund and sent them a photo of the room. Whilst I received an email saying that I would be refunded, I never have been. The first email was forgotten. I applied again after my holiday and it was as if I had never applied in the first place. I then got an email to say that the owner had agreed a full refund and Booking.com would send it on to me and get the money back from the owner, unless I wanted to claim it from the owner myself (why would l I when I paid Booking.com).It is now November and still no refund. I wrote again and got an email stating I would have to claim directly from the owner, even though I had forwarded the email from them stating that they would pay me. If I was going to deal with the owner directly, I would have booked with them in the first place! The owner doesn't speak English and I speak only tourist French.

Our holidaywas as good as it always is and the familiarity only makes the experience sweeter. Having explored Cyprus extensively over 24 years we know the island well, and our main reason for staying at Konnos Bay Hotel Apartments is that of relaxing in a perfect (for us) environment. We always have the same apartment overlooking the beautiful bay. and we swim in the crystal clear waters twice a day (morning and afternoon) for at least an hour or more on each occasion. For those who want a more active time, Mike's Water Sports offers a complete range of activities, with safety as the prine consideration.We have made many Cypriot friends over the years, amonst them the manager Adamandini ably supported by Tsonga. The care and attention and support from Adamandini is second to none, and she will solve any problem which may arise, again ably supported by Tsonga. It is not just us who gets this support, although we are made to feel special, Adamandini makes every guest feel special. There were small improvements this year, with new beds and mattresses, but the same feeling of contentment made the holiday as special as it always is. Perhaps what makes Konnos Bay special for us is the wonderful view of the bay, and, even the walk down from our apartment to the beach in the rural settings. We spend a lot of time just relaxing on our balcony, reading lots of books, swimming in the crystal clear warm sea. The rooms have a kettle, a toaster and a microwave (the microwave is a welcome recent addition. We usually have breakfast in our apartment and generally eat out every evening. This year we discovered a new restaurant in Protars (Island Affair) and it has become our favourate (I have posted a seperate review of this restaurant). I should say that Pirillis restaurant at Konnos Bay has greaty inoroved, and can also be recommended.We always have a car, which generally we use only for going oput in the evenings and shopping at the quite large Lidl store for basics such as milk, water, etc but they do have an excellent selection of wine, spirits, etc. We rent our car from Windmills Car Rental in Protaras, and I have previously posted a review on that service, which is excellent value and totally reliable. Having said that, for those who do not want a car, there is an excellent bus service right outside Konnos Bay Hotel Apartment, and very cheap,I would strongly recommend Konnos Bay Hotel Apartmens for a totally relaxing holiday, more so, but different, from staying in a five star hotel! Will we be returning to Konnos Bay in 2019?

The property in question is Sea View Apartment in Down Town, 7 Sofiivs'ka Street in Odessa, which is a a fraudulent listing, offering a price way under market value. On the spot they will ask for much more, or refuse you to stay there. If you try to complain to the owner he will simply stop picking up the phone. So far, booking refused to take any action on this, duping possibly much more customers.",2,0,en,Bookingstar2345
1026,Customer,unknown,2018-10-13T10:17:03.000Z,Booking.com let me down.,Booking.com let me down.Stayed at Heathrow Premier Inn for 1 night and not impressed. When we arrived we were told that it was valet parking at ¬£16.50 and our car would be moved to another car park so had to hand over our car keys or move it yourself. Well with 2 children in tow and luggage this was not possible as a busy road between the car park and hotel. So handed the keys over and paid the fee. I'm upset that this was not explained on Booking.com. I have stay with Premier Inn many times before so was very happy with the stay. Just annoyed that Booking.com didn't inform me of this. Another annoying unseen point was the distance from Chessigton world of adventure to hotel. I type in hotels in Chessington area and Heathrow came up saying 5 miles away. Will this wasn't true either as more like 26 miles away. Never again will I take Booking.com word for it and will be double checking hotels in future for true statistics. Not impressed at all the the service of Booking.com,2,0,en,Bookingstar2345

Each time I have booked with them the service has been terrible and the last time I was left stranded with no accommodation in a foreign country alone and they didn't care. They just said oh well try and find something else as we haven't charged you yet!. This time however was different. I booked a room in a hotel (I thought) for a week in Miami. When the confirmation came through it turns out it was holiday let inside a hotel but was not part of the hotel. We were able to use the facilities at the hotel but the room was basic and there were no services offered by the hotel during our stay. We did feel like we were second class and it was a little embarrassing. The confirmation was clear when it came and the correspondence from the owners of the holiday let was excellent. The room was good as a base but wasn't as we thought it would be. I wouldn't go out of my to book with booking.com as I do find their customer service and support the worst ever but have given 3 stars as my experience was good this time but the way the room was advertised was very misleading. I did contact them about this but as you can guess I had no response. All in all I wouldn't book with this company unless there was no other option.,3,0,en,Bookingstar2345

Some things persons visiting the area should know  especially short term rentals like ours:No wash cloths (byo) No hair dryer (byo) Pillows are inadequate on King sized bed (they are full sized pillows)No paper towels (byo) Toilet paper is provided but not enough for over a couple days (byo) TV is not a Smart TV,  if you want to watch Netflix,  Hulu etc.  Bring your own Amazon FirestickTowels are provided but only for a day so be prepared to wash towels daily.

Bring your own or paper towels.  Very large closet in master with 3 hangers.  Byo  hangers. The washer and dryer are very old and cumbersome to use,  the dryer has a piece of wire fashioned as a handle for opening the dryer.   Once you hear the dryer buzzer go off that your load is dry... You pull the rigged handle to open the door but the dryer is still spinning so it's like a I Love Lucy episode retrieving your flying laundry from the dryer.  The apartment is located near many restaurants and there is a Big lots within a couple miles  you will probably need it,  that's where I purchased the above items for our stay so byo  or plan on spending more money on the apartment you rented.

I have been using booking.com for over 1 year now and made a few bookings with them. All went well until my last experience. I booked a house for Christmas in Austria. When I looked it online I have noticed that the same house was cheaper on Airbnb with about 150‚Ç¨. Because I don't like to change service providers and conditioned by the fact that on their website says they do price match I booked it on booking.com knowing that I will get the difference back. On both websites were the same dates, same no of people and same house. When I called booking.com to get my difference I spoke to a really nice lad who, after checking with his manager informed me that I will not get the difference back as the cancellation terms were not completely identical with the ones from Booking.com. I told them I am not interested in the cancellation policy as I am not canceling a property with them, I am booking one for which I was promissed a price matche. And for the purpose of the argument, the difference on Airbnb is that if you cancel the booking you dont get refunded their fees but you get back the rest of the amount. I feel that I was mislead by their false advertising and I am considering to close my account with them as I cant see how I can trust them anymore. I am curious if someone will answer to this or do something about it. Hope this is useful for others. If something changes I will keep you posted. CheersI wanted to edit this review because I promised I will get back with an update. Booking.com came back to their senses and offered me the price match. Even if I don't appreciate the hassle of having to go through this I have to give it to them in the end and say they were fair, eventually.

He offered a Euros50 so we emailed bookings.com to say we may have a resolution, and could they call us back. No call.Then things turned ugly with the hotel manager when I explained that the 50 euros discount should be applied to the room prices he was offering, and not the original booking of 4 rooms. This meant our reduction was only 50 euros instead of 100 Euros. The manager told us to take the deal he offered or leave. We didnt have much option as bookings.com had not replied/called, and we had next to zero chance of finding another place nearby on our own in peak season.

Upon arriving, dishes were dirty in the dishwasher, no detergent to run it again, and leaking pipe under the sink (with a sauce pan under it). After contacting Booking.com and waiting to hear back a cleaning woman was sent to wash the dishes. She said that the owner knew about the pipe already. Daily we became aware of more problems, fridge not cooling properly, no TV remote, unusable washer and dryer and reported them through Booking.com.  None were resolved. After going to a laundromat for over 2 hours and all the unresolved complaints, I asked for partial reimbursement. Emailed twice through Booking.com and was told ""owner said no"". Sent a dispute with photos, and copies of emails asking for 1/2 day rental and the cost of laundry to be reimbursed. The Booking.com rep said ""...no compensation can be provided in this case."" And then ""Approaching property staff during your stay to address this issue was the right step. In the future, if you're unable to resolve a situation with a property, call our customer service. Our staff, who know the language and culture of the property, can help make communication easier.""  Really?! So I did everything I was suppose to do, creating stress, eating up time, spending additional money... but nothing was fixed and I still can't get even 1/10 of the total rental cost reimbursed? This is crazy. There isn't any recourse for misrepresentations? I'm relatively sure that people renting a ""home"" listing a TV, fridge, washer/dryer, and sink expect to have them working and usable during the stay. If not, how can you list them as amenities?I won't be using Booking.com again. They have a responsibility to the consumer to make sure the properties are accurately represented on their site and hold the owners/listed properties accountable. Clearly, they have misrepresented  themselves too.",2,0,en,Bookingstar2345

Doesn't have option for guest to tell owner they are bringing a dog (leading to issues with payments and house rules). Approval process tedious (and unnecessary as I already had 3 listed properties). Setup process seems to be repetitive (facilities tickboxes need ticking and then re-ticking). Policies setup obtuse (option to deviate from template is hidden). Entirely focused on hotels... my customers are booking a whole house but they insist on calling it a room. The property description (which the owner has no control over) is appalling ""xxx Cottage benefits from a summerhouse and a microwave"". I could go on and on...

I called Booking.com and explained our situation to the very helpful rep and that my cell phone battery was about to die.  The Rep faxed our confirmation to the hotel and then personally called them to ensure that they received it and confirm that we had a room.  She called us back 10 minutes later and gave us the name of the manager and confirmed that we were all set.  It took us over 90 minutes to drive 1 mile in the storm but we arrived at the hotel safely and bunkered down for the night.All night long we heard sirens and the next day we saw cars off the road in ditches, big rigs jackknifed on the highway and cars all up an down the highway median that had been abandoned by drivers.My own corporate travel was unable to help me as they said they could not find a room and did not seem to understand that we were in dire straights.

Booking.com really made a bad situation (which wasn‚Äôt their fault) into an amazing one. I booked somewhere in Vancouver for 4 nights, really nice apartment in good location and for my budget, was so happy, but then a few days later I‚Äôd had the reservation cancelled.. the host said something about the dates not being correct, and place not available. As Vancouver was selling out fast, and that being the only decent place left within budget, I was extremely upset, now having to find a new place. So I decided to call the helpline to see if they were allowed to cancel like that, (I‚Äôd have been penalised if I‚Äôd done it) their helpline is always open, another great thing about booking.com and staff always helpful. They told me no, they weren‚Äôt aloud to and if I‚Äôd like to find another place of the same facilities, they would reimburse me any extra costs. The first recommendation was not great, a 2 star, no parking etc so I found a place very similar to original booking but was ¬£200 more. Anyway after I stayed at the new, amazing lovely place in replacement of original, I tell booking.com that I‚Äôve stayed (could only get refund of difference after I stayed so yes, I did have to pay the extra up front) but 2 days later, the refund is in my account, pain free no hassle, exactly what they said they‚Äôd do. I‚Äôd read small print and followed instructions like they asked (to get refund) I see most negative experiences are down to people not reading small print. Amazing. I‚Äôm so grateful, the new place was better than original and it just made the whole thing extra special knowing I‚Äôd get some money back.

It might be true booking.com lists more properties but the the properties are not vetted, but some properties have a Star rating (between 1-5 stars) on them.Booked a 3 star property in Bradford in Mar/18 for 4 nights. It turned out to be a students accommodation, hosted in one of the students hall of Bradford University. Experience was not altogether bad - but the sink in the communal kitchen was blocked, and there was no toilet rolls in the bathroom, and not supplied even when requested. I accordingly left a mixed feedback, to which the host, rather than responding to my feedback at booking.com sent a message to my mobile directly ""Excuse me but where on our ad did i tell you we have house keeping? Where did you get your information that our property is student accommodation? I charged you ¬£18 a night what did you expect?? Next time i will not accept your booking please get a better job and pay for a hotel!!!"".I subsequently asked booking.com on what basis the Star ratings of properties determined. The response was ""Please note, as a general reference, that a star rating system seek to assess Hotel quality. The criteria for the attribution of the stars may vary per country. For general reference, the properties determine and check their classification with their local tourism authorities."".

For instance whether breakfast is included in the price or whether it is an add on. Also one of the hotels we booked had a swimming pool and spa and we planned to use the pool with our baby.

I was in Indonesia booking a hotel via their app and the internet connection was low, so I had a few connection error messages until finally my reservation gotten through. I then went on a Live Aboard in Raja Ampat, without internet connection until I got to the hotel. It's only then I found out that I got two booking confirmations and the hotel first insisted in me paying both but then agreed to have me pay just one room, as it was only me and clearly not my fault. This was the Fave Hotel in Sorong. I contacted booking.com right away via e-mail and they responded telling me they are messaging the hotel and I been told things should be fine. The hotel then went on to take money from me after I had left, without me authorizing the payment. Booking.com did only sent automated e-mails as an answer to my attempt to solve this until I finally got to call them, both people I spoke to, in Indonesia and home in England where friendly and helpful, but their e-mail customer service whom I was limited to during my travels is an absolute nightmare. I finally was offered 21 pounds from the 38 pounds double charge, which I at this point accepted as I been trying to get help for 2 weeks at that point. Basically I paid for the room I stayed in and 17 pounds for another room I never used and hadn't blocked as I only received one confirmation in my app. The transfer went quick. My advise is, if you have the option, go via hotels.com or Airbnb.

I always read reviews carefully before booking and I have never found a place radically different from what they have led me to believe. I also always contribute a review. My reservation about booking.com is the amount of money they take from hotels and how difficult they have made it for smaller hotels to survive without being on it.

Our first hotel cancelled our booking by sending me a message on booking.com saying they didn't have availability and asked me to, cancel. This was dispite receiving confirmation by booking.com. This was on the morning we were due to arrive. 2. As our original hotel cancelled at last minute I had to look that morning for available hotels. We chose one nearby, at a much higher rate, as not much else was available. When we arrived at the second hotel In the afternoon we were told they didn't have a booking for us.

1193,Stanislav ,unknown,2018-02-23T20:08:15.000Z,DON'T TRUST BOOKING.COM!,"Summary: The description of some of the hotels in Booking.com is wrong and misleading. On their website, I booked a hotel which was advertised as a 4-star hotel, although it doesn't have any stars.In February 2018, I had a business trip to London. I searched for 4-star hotel in the centre. I used the 4-star  filter in Booking.com and sorted the results by ratings. The first hotel in the list was Nadler Victoria Hotel, which I booked. When I arrived at the hotel, I was very disappointed by the situation there. The Nadler Victoria hotel apparently doesn't have a restaurant or a bar or actually, anything except rooms. It is an expensive fancy hostel advertised as a 4-star hotel, which it is not. I shared my concerns with the staff working at the reception desk, and they told me that Nadler Victoria Hotel doesn't have any stars and it is not categorised with the ""stars"" system. There are no stars on the website of the hotel, but there are stars at booking.com, which I find very misleading and false advertising.I wrote to Booking.com Customer Service, and I received a reply after 10 days. The answer was a simple CS template. Later, I received another email from CS, where I was offered 25 euros refund as a compensation for my troubles. This is simply ridiculous. I paid 400 euros for two nights. I would never book this hotel if I knew that it was not a proper 4-star hotel. I was misled by the false information in Booking.com, which they did not correct even when I sent them a complaint. It seems to me that they don't care and they just want their listings to look good in Booking.com.So, I am disappointed that a hotel without any stars is listed as 4-star hotel. I am disappointed that Booking.com did not admit or fixed their mistake. I am disappointed by their compensation proposal, although I used their services (Booking.com, Rentalcars.com, Agoda.com) from at least five years, maybe more.",2,1,en,Bookingstar2345

1222,Miss Brenda Spiller,unknown,2018-01-10T23:28:24.000Z,Caveat emptor - Let the buyer beware!,"I have been using Booking.com since 2011, and qualify as a genius or frequent traveller as I have made over 70 bookings  and up until the last 6 months I would have rated their service highly. Sadly, like many of the reviewers, their service has changed and twice in recent past I have been charged for bookings that were 'pay at property' options (the only way I ever book), and on both occasions it has been hassle to get the money refunded.  So two strikes and you are out, as far as I am concerned, so when this recent charge is refunded, I will stop using Booking.com, and advise others to think very carefully before using this service.It needs to be understood that the suppliers of the hotel services input their information and terms into the Booking.com system, however,  it can't be that 'one size fits all', as a consequence the Terms of Booking vary, and if you  don't read carefully the booking form pages then  you can end up with an immediate charge or pre authorisation you don't expect and only find out after confirmation - a matter I have taken up with Booking.com more than once in recent months - including writing to their CEO Gillian Tans.This is what has happened to me twice in recent months, the last time being December yet I read the detail very carefully, and I only ever book using the option of 'pay at the property'  and I have  still been charged immediately.  The refund, needless to say takes forever, with form filling, and the customer service staff of course  implying  that it is my fault, and I made the mistake...which I haven't in either case.Booking.com does not check their suppliers details in their website, nor their terms of business, I doubt that the people in customer service even understand them.  The booking form us customers see doesn't necessarily reflect what will happen in practice. So in my view the Booking.com system is no longer fit for purpose.I used to recommend it to my friends (without the incentive they offer) however have now stopped, and I wouldn't recommend anyone use it.  Booking.com can no longer be trusted as far as I am concerned.IN REPLY TO THE BOOKING.COM RESPONSE, who seemed to have missed the point, it is still stressful because it is still a current problem.  If you had read my details I always review the hotels I stay in...I have given a lot of feedback, this however does not prevent monies being taken when it should not be taken. Either you have an option to Pay at the Property or you don't.  If your system does work on some and not others then you need to do something about the programming.  At the time of the recent incident I had booked 6 other hotels all in the same period of time, so why do 6 work on my option and 1 doesn't!Additionally I won't be reviewing this particular hotel that has given me a problem because I cancelled the booking and we don't get to review cancelled bookings...hence the problem with the refund, which still has not been repaid!So asking me to give feedback is a bit pointless...I have provided feedback here...will Booking.com take any notice - I doubt it.",2,0,en,Bookingstar2345

Choosing a good accommodation and especially a value for money depends on preferences and is not a simple task.In general it is a good suggestion to AVOID accommodations with lower than 10 reviews and lower than 8 rating. The more the reviews and comments, the better. You also have to read and balance the comments and especially replies.Pictures are usually misleading and are used like potato chip commercials. You always get less than what they advertise you!Moreover check carefully the cancellation policy and the local taxes paid on arrival. There are too many variations and you do not want surprises.On the other hand with booking.com you may be a good guide in order to find and contact the ""perfect"" accommodation directly.

The problem is that it has become sloppy towards there clients and business partners. In a few years ago, a real person would deal with problems as they occurred until it was solved. Nowadays, the company works with call center employees who cannot follow up on a problem personally. There is no one to take responsibility. The whole operation is now geared towards making as much money as fast as possible, excepting that here and there there will be disappointed customers. The pas three weeks we have met so many problems with no help from Booking.com whatsoever, that I'm done with them. I am prepared to pay more for better service. In future, I will use Booking.com only to find fine hotels and then book directly or through a competitor. (Again, you must admit that the site has some great features).",2,1,en,Bookingstar2345

In general, Booking.com provides a reasonable service, however this particular experience - although eventually resolved completely - was a little bit sour.I was looking for a last-minute 2 night stay in Leeds, UK, and ended up being presented (at the very top of my list) with an 'apartment' style of accomodation that had been heavily discounted (70%) from its ""standard"" price. The cost seemed reasonable and completely in line with a number of other hotels and accomodation in the area for that time. I went through the entire booking process only to find that the eventual cost ended up to be two and a half times what was quoted on the initial ""Price for 2 nights"" page as the accomodation had added a very, very hefty nightly service charge (equivalent to more than the rate that I had been quoted for each night of accomodation) AND a cleaning fee. I only discovered this AFTER payment was taken. As it turns out, the accomodation hadn't correctly added the service charges in to the Booking.com system and hence the price ended up being way, way different to that which was originally quoted.Although this was resolved, this is meant to be a comparison site. Having a price listed for accomodation and then failing to quote the entire cost of the property makes it far more difficult to do a like-for-like cost comparison.",3,0,en,Bookingstar2345

A few times I had an issue, such as booking room with a balcony in a hotel, where there are no balconies. On the other occasion it was the price. If you choose hotel currency and you come to the hotel they may tell you that they except only local currency which doesn't match with your destination currency.

I contacted booking.com the following morning and explained my situation and the urgency for them to provide another place (I had a film crew and cast that were expecting a venue to at film at in less than 6 hours). The agent himself was shocked by my experience and stated that a cancellation could not be processed unless both parties agreed to it he stated that my response had not been sent, thus the cancellation should not have been permitted. He tried to reach the property provider, but could not he also couldn't reach the agent that over rode the system to permit the cancellation - as the person was away.

1292,Melissa,unknown,2017-09-16T08:09:40.000Z,Booking.com has gone downhill and I can no longer recommend them,"Booking.com used to be amazing.  I would rave to everyone about how their customer service would always try to help you, even if you might need to cancel a night outside of policy etc.  Recently, I've had a string of bad experiences with booking.com and have come to realise that the company has drastically changed.  Recent bad experiences include: 1. Misleading and deceptive pricing: I booked an apartment in San Sebastian.  Throughout the booking process, the price was flashed in big numbers with the book now button. I proceeded with the booking and after it confirmed the payment it had added ‚Ç¨50 on for cleaning! When I rang booking.com, after a massive wait on hold they told me that the cleaning fee was advised nearby the price.  Why wouldn't you just include it in the total price you are stating throughout the booking?  If I want to worry about cleaning fees and other hidden fees, then I'd just use AirBnB.  This happened yet again at another property just last week, even though I had looked through the details of the pricing quite thoroughly.  I literally had to dig through my whole reservation and search for where it advised me of the cleaning fee after the owner of the property asked me to pay for it.  Hey Booking.com - not being transparent in your pricing is not going to win you happy customers. In the first instance the guy from customer service was doing his best in fairness and gave me some discount off the cleaning fee but I do still feel cheated. 2. False Advertising & No responsibility taken: I booked a property in a small town in Italy and wanted to make sure I could park nearby to the property as my Mum couldn't walk very far.  Spent time using all the filters to find a place that offered free parking on site etc. Finally booked a place that advertises free parking on site. I call the place as we're nearing and the guy tells me the parking is in the public car park at the entrance to the town and is ‚Ç¨10 per day. Not a big deal, but if I'd factored in the cost of the parking I might have picked a different property who had clearly stated that.  So for me this clearly false advertising. I ring Booking.com to explain the situation, to which the response is ""we are just a platform, the property owner can write whatever they like.  If you want to cancel we will have to call the property to see if they will waive the cancellation fee."" At this point I'm shocked, since Booking.com should realise that the contract should be invalid because of the false information in the listing. Anyhow, the property accepts the cancellation and all is fine, but they didn't have to according to Booking.com and Booking.com were not willing to stand by the information published on their site. 3. Availability issues: I spent a good hour trying to select a property.  Finally settled on one, booked it then went to bed. 10 minutes later my phone starts buzzing with messages. The owner of the property is sending me WhatsApps saying that she forgot to update her availability with Booking.com and that the property isn't available for that date and I need to cancel. Her cancellation policy would mean I'd have to pay for the night, so I told her no, she would need to ring Booking.com to explain the situation and cancel. She responds that it's too late in the evening but she'll do it in the morning. So now I have to spend the night unsettled about where I'm supposed to sleep the following night because I don't want to book another room without knowing I'm going to get my refund. In the morning, I had another issue (the next one on my list) so have to call Booking.com anyhow. I mention this cancellation by the owner and they have to call her etc to confirm this is the case. They come back to me to confirm and tell me the reason she can't honour the booking is because her toilet is broken. Which is not the case at all since the property owner told me she had overbooked. Maybe not Booking.com's fault because it seems the property owner lied to them for whatever reason but it just looks really bad all round.  Not to mention I used to be able to rely on my bookings through the site, but now it seems I have to worry about whether property owners have updated their availability etc etc.  Again, I might as well be using Air BnB and dealing with individuals directly. Booking.com on this did in fairness handle the cancellation well and offered to pay the difference on alternative accommodation and their customer service was efficient about handling it. Still a lot of back and forth on the phone though to fix the situation. Then once it's all confirmed the woman from the property starts sending me messages again to understand what happened on the phone with Booking.com, if she was in trouble for lying to them etc etc. Quite a hassle. 4. Hidden Charges: The morning after I book a property, as I'm finishing my coffee about to head to the place, I receive an email from the property informing me that they are a holiday apartment and therefore they do not provide sheets and towels, and that if I want sheets and towels I will have to pay a ‚Ç¨40 charge. We were only staying in the place for one night. I ring the place furious - by this point I'm so angry with Booking.com and their deceptive ways of doing business.  The guy is surprisingly nice and says he'll speak to the owner and see what they can do.  Says the reason it isn't mentioned in the listing is that Booking.com doesn't give them anywhere to include this charge. It all works out and he apologises and says they will waive the fee this time, thankfully. I advise Booking.com regardless because, if I wasn't willing to stand up for myself, I would again have been slugged with extra hidden fees. Pricing should be TRANSPARENT. Include your fees in the price advertised. Not in small text.  Not after the fact. The email regarding the extra charges was sent via the Booking.com system and I also advised them of the email. They didn't seem to care, since it was resolved. They shouldn't be allowing these sorts of practices.  I've now had it up to my neck with Booking.com, I'm clearly seeing that I need to find alternatives for my travel because they can no longer be relied up. Most of the time customer service are helpful and polite, so that's at least a plus but I don't want to have to be calling customer service so many times when I'm supposed to be on holidays. I'm also losing money because I have to call the UK line (they seem to give better service than the Italian line). I lost hours trying to fix up the issues, when I should have been lying on the beach. Look for alternative sites. Book with proper hotels. If you want to stay at someone's apartment, try going through AirBnB. At least on their site they are more obvious about not being transparent with the pricing and you expect a mess with the property owners.I would change my mind a be a fan of Booking.com once more if they went back to including all charges in the quoted prices and agreed to stand by the information published in the listings on their site.",2,0,en,Bookingstar2345

In the morning pool of water appears and lecky goes off. Try key holder who again ignores my calls and texts. Phone booking customer service again and within 20 mins key holder shows up with boiler man etc and problems are resolved.

The girl I spoke to was absolutely wonderful, she explained that they had been having some problems with the app reverting to a date from a previous search so there were a lot of people who had the same problem as myself.

Their search facilities are excellent and their booking process very easy, however be prepared for them to tell you that you will pay at the hotel but then take full payment from your card up to two weeks prior to arrival. After speaking to the hotels, they don't even get the payment for several weeks after the stay. I brought this to the attention of Booking.com with photographic evidence and they can't even be bothered to respond to calls or emails. Secondly I arrived at one hotel in France and the room was the owners bedroom (not as described on Booking.com website) I contacted Booking.com from the hotel and I was informed it is an issue between me and the hotel owner and it was not an issue for them. From my recent experiences it appears Booking.com have become less customer focused and far less helpful. My advice is use other sites such as Trivago, Hotel.com or after finding the hotel ring them directly.Booing.com ... get focused on your customers!*** In answer to your response, I'm not on Facebook!!

They were charging me close to 200 pounds for a 5 nights stay in a hotel with bugs and non-working wifi. I decided to cut my vacation short and leave that hotel after one of the receptionists was quite rude. I don't want any of their refunds but an apology would be preferable.

Complained to both the hotel and Booking.com and it was agreed that we would get a refund for one night.  Well here we are in July and no refund. I emailed them both most days and most days did not even get a reply. The hotel sent me an email of a refund receipt to a Master Card, however my payment was made by a Visa Card and went through Paypal. I sent both Booking.com and the hotel a copy of the payment receipt to show that the refund did not go back to my card or even my bank account and still nothing.  I contacted Paypal also but as there was nowhere that I could raise the complaint other than goods not as described, Paypal said ""During our review, we found that your seller had sufficiently described the merchandise"" and ""If you wish to pursue this issue, we encourage you to contact your seller directly for resolution"", so much for Paypal Protection.  I did explain to Paypal that they refunded to the wrong account, it was Booking.com gave this account number etc to the hotel.  I have an email from Booking.com telling me I paid by Master card and I replied with the payment receipt again showing Visa card and they have ignored that email also.  I will probably never use Booking.com again and most certainly would never recommend them to anyone.  Shame on you Booking.com, I really don't know how you cannot see the mess you made when1.

After 30 mins, we get a call from booking.com saying the owners made a mistake in the price and would like us to pay more. I told the booking.com rep that we would absolutely not pay one cent more than the advertised price. At this point, he was on hold with the apartment owner on the other line. The booking.com rep spoke to the owner of the apartment passing on our message. He came back to me after terminating the call with the apartment owner, saying that it was resolved and that the apartment owner would honour the agreed upon price. The booking.com rep was very professional and helpful throughout the whole call.The one thing I did not like is that they called us about it.

I've had this problem when I traveled with my dog and a hotel asked a huge fee for it although on booking.com it stated that it should be free and another time when the hotel asked for an upfront payment, although I already paid through booking.com. Booking either didn't responf to emails concerning this or was very slow to solve this after telephone calls.

1433,Jacque Small,unknown,2017-03-04T17:33:40.000Z,A Hosts Perspective,"I am a host on Booking.com and for the most part find their service to me to be excellent.  As a host I am here to provide accommodations and service and in return earn an income.  It is the property that collects money from the guest, not Booking.com, they simply provide the means of booking.  So if you can't get your money back then it is your review of the property that counts.  People read property reviews, before booking. Double bookings ---  This is my biggest problem.  About 95% of the people in the country where I live, do not show up for reservations, nor do they cancel, and they lie saying they will be there in 2 hours then don't come.   Hence, I don't hold rooms for people more than 2 hours after check-in, unless I have a deposit.  I know my policy causes those of you who are considerate problems, unfortunately the number of inconsiderate people have forced my hand in order that I can achieve the objective of earning a reasonable income. Customer Service -- Booking.com at least has a phone number to call.  Much better than another site I host on.  And yes, I have my frustrations, but for the most part they try pretty hard.",5,0,en,Bookingstar2345

On the third phone call i get from Booking.com the customer service admitted that there was a mistake from Booking.com mistake but due to low price i ve booked, i had to accept hotels price or cancel it for free. Even if i wanted to stay on this hotel i wouldnt due to hotel managers treatment. So i would like to thank you Booking.com for only admitting your mistake in words and not in deeds. I ve booked a price , as you say the price is guaranteed, but the price was wrong and i had to pay the difference without even know anything. So thank you Booking.com for almost ruining my stay to Dakar trying to find hotel in the middle of the day while i had meeting in the middle.",2,0,en,Bookingstar2345

1471,Antti Nevalainen,unknown,2016-12-22T16:13:20.000Z,A confirmed booking is not confirmed booking. booking.com does not handle credit cards properly,"They let you book a room for example with Amex and do not tell you that the Amex card is not accepted by the hotel. You will get booking confirmation immediately, but after 2-3 days the problems begin.  They will ask you to re-enter the card details and even at this stage don't tell you that you should change to another card. I entered the card details again, without knowing that the problem is ""Amex not accepted"". After few days the same story repeated.The worst thing is that you should change the card within 24 hours or your already confirmed reservation is cancelled. If you are travelling a lot you sometimes don't read your e-mails for longer period than 24 hours. This is what happened to me.

It suddenly dawned on me in September that once again we had to complain about the room we were allocated. On request we were always moved to a better room at no extra charge. In Lincoln the hotel check out staff were so embarrassed about the scruffiness of the room we were allocated that they deducted charge for the dog. I could list loads of examples now that we finally understood what was happening. In Riva del Garda this summer the manager suggested that we book directly with the hotel I order to get a decent room. He said Booking.com charges the, a large fee and that we could negotiate the Booking.com quoted price with the hotel to get a good deal. It was good advice and we shall be trying it on our next holiday. Don't use Bookimg.com.

I was looking to prepay in Sterling (as I'm used from other sites) to avoid expensive bank fees such as debit card charges for foreign currency transactions. As the prices were quoted in Sterling by booking.com this seems like a reasonable expectation. After I booked the non refundable deal I realised however that payment is not taken by booking.com but by the hotel later on. I will be charged in the hotel currency which means high bank and debit card fees and due to fluctuations in the exchange rate I may have to pay even more in the end. Booking.com is misleading and I won't use it again. I will actually incur around ¬£350 in additional expenses than the prices quoted by booking.com. Not such a good deal after all.

1561,Peg Birch,unknown,2016-04-30T11:28:24.000Z,Beware! Booking Confirmation worthless - bounced into inferior room,"Travelling with a friend in Puglia, she booked a room for our final two nights in Trani. The room we booked had one (real) bed on a mezzanine, a double sofa-bed below, and was visibly light and airy and described as having a balcony. She received an e mail confirmation from booking.com confirming that this was the room we had booked for 2 nights. When we arrived, not only was the place not an actual guest house (as stated in the title) but we were shown into a much inferior room - very little natural light and only one double bed and a fold-up single in the corner, so no physical separation of beds/privacy at all. The kitchen was tiny and poorly equipped, there was no balcony or external space of any kind, the shower was so tiny you could only sit in it and the shower head had to be held in your hand, and it was a ten-minute walk to a cafe for which we were given a token for breakfast, which consisted of one item from a selection of cakes and one cup of coffee. Apparently somebody had come along with a better offer after our booking was made and was in the room we had booked for 9 nights - effectively we had been bounced - but nowhere on the booking website was there a description of the second room, and if we had seen  an accurate description of the accommodation we were given we would never have booked it. Oh well - these things happen. My friend posted a review, which although not exactly positive was perfectly accurate and objective. We were then both woken the following night after midnight by a volley of irate 'What'sApp' messages from the owner, which were less than welcome. I have sent two e mails to booking.com's customer service section but have had absolutely no response, which I think is disgusting! I will avoid using them again if at all possible.

Now, I am using them less and less. Why? Their prices are only the lowest about half the time now, far fewer of their hotel options offer free cancellation, and their customer service has become like that of most other companies, meaning that they do not even seem to understand English, and if you press the point, they simply tell you that they cannot help you. Customer service people who say THEY cannot help you with a booking that THEY are doing or with some dysfunction on THEIR website are a complete joke. Finally, I recently have trouble trying to alter bookings. For example, I cannot change  bookings that offer FREE changes and cancellation because the ""rooms are not available."" How can rooms not be available when I am merely trying to shorten the length of my stay by one day? My theory? They want you to have to cancel the booking and re-book at what is now a higher price.

The booking was confirmed by booking.com the same day without any conditions or mentioning that it had to be reconfirmed. When we arrived with our three children - and five suitcases - by taxi at the confirmed adress in London we called booking.com - to find out that they cancelled our booking 16 hours before by e-mail! They blamed the owner of the estate for overbooking and offered us another appartment in a totally different part of London. As we were stranded in London we saw no other possibility than to accept the other appartment which did not meet our requirements at all. We spent a lot of pointless time moving around on the first day - and travelling by bus and tube the following days due to this unacceptable cancellation. On top of this, three men arrived at our appartment on our last day - they were from Ireland and they had booked the appartment for one night, confirmed by booking.com.

It would be nice to have also a sidebar with the list of the hotels, so that if I click one I can see where it is on the map without loosing sight of the distribution of all the results of the search.

When i requested your rep she failed to turn up for the appointment and i had to chase her the next day. I was shocked to hear that the tour operators do not have a checklist to see who is on flight and in her own words said ""it was not the mentality of the Spanish"". I had to go to reception to make sure they would pick us up on return journey. there was some confusion at the airport on landing. Another passenger was in the same boat as myself but his tour operator paid for his taxi. He was going to Costa Brava. I am really disappointed as this is my first time to go with you and book on line. I would only book now through a travel agency, it may be a little more expensive but at least the quality of service is better. The spanish have investigated my case and are not reimbursing me.

Booking.com called me very shortly afterwards to let me know that there was a problem with the booking in regards to the number of people in each room . The price quoted and confirmed in my booking was for single occupancy and not double. Feeling confused ,as I had selected the correct number of occupants for each room(2) in the drop down boxes and added the names of the people  in each room in the space provided I asked booking.com to  check the price again. The pricing did not change when the lady at customer services checked twice,putting 2 in each room. There apparently, had been a glitch when I booked and the boxes had apparently reverted to single occupancy ,although from my end I could see that it clearly stated 2 per room! A short while later ,another call to tell  me that the owners at the B&B had questioned the booking because the price was ¬£147 lower than the amount they charge for 3  nights ,double occupancy. Would I agree to go ahead with the correct pricing from the owners? Well, I didn't think I could afford to, so after an hours thinking time I agreed to pay the final full amount,I didn't want to miss out on my only break for the year and had not been away for several years. The B&B like a cash payment on arrival so I had a little longer to save. Now the surprising bit...a lovely email from booking.com to  tell me that they didn't expect me to pay more than the original price as this wasn't fair. They asked me to send them a receipt after my stay and they would refund me the difference (¬£147). I am happy to say that they did,within a week of my stay!!

You can create a social net based on your clients OR to give clients to e0mail each to other. E.g. I want to ask  people with interesting reviews about their opnion on specific details.3. You have to develop a standard set of property pictures including entrance, surrounding and view from windows.4.

The choice of items is not listed and it is necessary to look at the client reviews to see if it is worth the money or not.Parking details are still a problem.

Sometimes it says it has to be pre-booked but does not tell you how to do it.I would also like to know if a hotel is up a steep hill.

All I have to do is click Booking.com in my favourites, and I am on the site that makes all those needs come to me. Honestly, I am a picky, demanding, and overly diligent s.o.b. and I can say without one word of a lie, ""I have NEVER had a problem with any of Booking.com's promises, offers, policies, nothing EVER"", and as you know, I have made approximately 30-40 bookings through the site in the last 4-5 years. If they say it's 20% off, you can be assured they will give it to you with no extra work needed on my behalf. If there's a deal for $55.43 a night, you can be GUARANTEED that's the rate you will get...no ands, ifs, or buts. I have NEVER had to contact Booking.com with even a small issue. The sites on the net need to take lessons from Booking.com as to how to run a customer-pleasing, simple to work with, and exteremely reliable business. I don't even check other sites out because Booking.com IS THAT RELIABLE. Use them, browse them, throw everything at them you see on their pages and I can tell you that you will still get exactly what you need, what you want, and what you like, in exactly the way that you need, want, and like it.

1990,Brian Lincoln,unknown,2014-02-16T19:25:45.000Z,Not happy with being quoted in pounds then charged in euros!,"I'm quite happy paying in euros, but we were quoted a guaranteed price in UK pounds which is what I expected to pay on my UK Credit Card. Once I had completed the transaction I find that my credit card will be charged in euros, which will now cost me more. I am not happy with this process. If I'm expected to pay in euros then quote prices in euros. So, for me I didn't get best price. I should have booked via the Accor website, and will do next time!",3,0,en,Bookingstar2345
