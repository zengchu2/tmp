I have used booking.com many times in the past, but I do not know if they changed ownership or management, but they have changed for the worse. Their helpline is only there to create a buffer between management and customers. Emails are not answered. We had a booking and suddenly a week later and 2 weeks before our departure they cancelled. Booking said they had tried to contact us because the wrong rate had been applied. I was never contacted but they said they tried to contact us on the app. I do not have the app. These people have my email address and up till then they sent everything to my email address. There was no way I got any communication.And then to change the rate a week later? When I was in touch with the owner the rate had not changed. I just would not get the Booking discount. Not much of a discount if they hold onto 1300 E. The owner says that Booking cancelled and Booking said the owner cancelled. I was on the phone several times with Customer NON service people who are no doubt nice girls who are doing Booking's dirty work. They cannot and will not let you speak to any management. I suspect Booking uses the cash they hold onto for their own purposes as an interest free loan. 7 to 12 days before one gets a refund. In this day and age when money can be transferred across borders within minutes. Really? I also read on other reviews one is lucky to get a refund at all.

I emailed them to let them know on booking, then called twice. No one answered or replied to my email. I then got to the property late at night after a flight hoping for the best. However when I got there, there were no instructions for what to do. The door was locked to the building and the hostel was on a different floor. I called the number on the door, someone did answer and said to wait for someone to let me in. After convincing someone, she did let me in, however she was on a different floor so I then had to wait for someone to actually let me onto the right level. This took quite a long time and was quite stressful. Once I finally got to the reception floor, I requested to get the keys out of the lockbox, however the man on the phone demanded a $100 deposit over the phone. I had paid in full prior to arriving and this was no where to be found on the website - I explained that I did not have a card capable of doing so, so in the morning I could pay him in cash or with my Eftpos card. He said no, that I could get cash out now. It was about 10:30pm, and if I were to get cash out it would have required me to again leave the building and try get back in. Plus - if he wasn't there, where the heck was I going to leave the cash anyway? I explained to him that I had given notice that I was going to be late and no one had gotten back to me, so if we could please just let me in my room and we can sort it out in the morning. The man refused, so I said well I guess I can't stay here because if I leave, I can't get back in. He was extremely rude about the entire situation and told me to talk with Booking.com as I requested a refund. So far, I have called Booking.com multiple times and no one has been able to get me an answer, with City Lifestyle labelling me in their system as a \"no show\" therefore I'm ineligible for a refund. It's utter nonsense and lead to me being alone late at night in Melbourne with no where to stay. I have called Booking.com multiple times and emailed them but have had absolutely no luck getting a resolution. The agents I've spoken with can't even speak English and had no idea what my issue was in the first place. One of the agents I spoke to put me on hold after I explained the situation, then she came back on to ask me \"if I stayed there\" ... I was like ... the entire point of the story was that they didn't let me in to stay and now apparently I'm a no show, so no.

Short summary, they do not honor what they advertise or what your reservation states.  I booked a 2 night stay in Canyon Lake Tx. The listing  stated that I could cancel or change my reservation up until the day before I checked in. The confirmation email confirmed this information. 5 days before I was to leave for the trip, I recieved an email stating my card would be charged in full at 5 o'clock. Surprised by this I contacted customer service. I after explaining this and telling two customer reps that if I was to be charged that day, I wanted to change the card I had provided because I was not allowed to enter my credit card when I made the resercation and had to use my debit card and that i wanted to change my reservation for one less night. They were unable to contact the hotel to change the reservation and asked if I could wait and they would get back to me. I asked if I could at least change the card but was told to wait and make the changes. They confirmed that I would NOT be charged that day at 5, and that I had until the day before check in. I agreed. 2 hours later at 5 my card was charged. I called again, and was told that nothing could be done. I was out the money and that thier system did this automatically. I asked to speak to anohter rep, and they disconnnected the call. 4 hours of calling and waiting they told me that they could give me refund but that i would loose the reservation, now days away from my trip (all the hotels were booked up at this point and the few available room in the town were 4x the amount i had made my reservation for. I asked if we could contact the hotel and explain the situation, if my reservation was canceled, why couldnt I rebook the same room at the same rate? They told me they still could not get in touch with my hotel (this went on for 8 hours). The hotel told me that i had to deal with booking.com since the reservation went through them. The rep argued with me that i recieved an email about being charged days early, but I insisted that was not what my confirmation email said, and conintued to show them what the other reps wrote me assuring me I would not be charged. They told me that the system works on Amsterdam time. I am in Texas as I the hotel I booked at. No where is this listed noted. However this is a moot point as they still charged me days earlier then agreed, even with \"Amersterdam\" time. The customer srvice was nice until they had my money and then they were unheloful and rude, In total I spoke with 6 different reps. I finally was transferred (after asking and calling for hours) to a manager and then the call was disconnected (again). At that same moment I got an email from the manager offereing me $20 for my trouble and stating they could do my request. By then I had noted that english was the second language and our conversations were going in circles. so I asked for clarification on what was to be done. Nothing was to be done. They could refund my money and I would have to find another room and cover the increased costs, they were not going to try and help me. I was told to accept what is. In exasperation I told them to refund my money and then was told it would be over two weeks before i saw the refund. They emptied my bank account days before my trip, lied to me, gave me wrong information, refused to do anything about it. I contacted the hotel myself and they gave me my room back at a rate that is $25 more a night, but the rate days before my trip was double what is what when I booked a month ago so I considered myself lucky that the hotel had better customer service then booking.com. Also, the refused to honor the $20 aploogy in the end stating they should not have offered it to me. This all went down while i was attending bridal shower, which i basically missed because i was on the phone the entire time and several hours after. Friends who heard parts of my calls starting offering me a roll away at thier hotel. That is kind but it was embarrassing and the focus was on my booking.com problem and not the bride. I will never use Booking.com again, they are dishonest, do not honor what they advertise or tell you in writing, they cost me a day of my time, and $100 for a new room, not to mention the stress of the entire situation.","review_rating":1,"num_like":1,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":112,"author":"Olga Witkowska","location":"unknown","date":"2022-05-30T23:27:22.000Z","headline":"Horrible!!","review_body":"Horrible!!!

Subsequently they cancelled the booking and issued me a refund (which would take 10-12 days to process).I was told I would receive an alternate option for accommodation at the same price point, that concept was ridiculous as we had booked the accommodation in advance and there was no way you'll find accommodation at the same price, in London, the day of the event. After a further 30 minutes, we were sent an option on the completely opposite side of London, in a low rated hotel for one room.We declined this option and asked for alternatives closer to the event venue and had no further correspondence from booking.com, until 2 days later when we got sent the same option again by a different colleague (two days after the booking date).To say that I am disappointed with this company... is an understatement. From now on, I'll book directly with the hotels\/private accommodations themselves.","review_rating":1,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":124,"author":"Steve Cranko","location":"unknown","date":"2022-05-30T12:12:16.000Z","headline":"Tricked into a higher rate by Booking.com","review_body":"Tricked into a higher rate, spent at least \u20ac135 for a night more than I intended.

I had an apartment booked and, as always with Booking com had paid in advance . We arrived at the agreed time but couldn't gain access. I accessed the Booking. com site and it stated under check in instructions \"key collection takes place at the property' . Need more details contact the owner'. I tried she wasn't responding and in desperation I contacted Booking.com. After a lengthy wait and then explaining my situation, the representative said she would try and return my call within 15 mins. She never did.Ten minutes later I received a message from the owner asking if I needed a permit. I responded immediately stating we couldn't gain access and had been stood outside the property for 20 minutes. She ignored my text. Realising she wasn't going to respond I again spent 15 minutes attempting to make contact with booking.com, eventually speaking with a representative who also failed to provide the information on their system regarding access. After a lengthy discussion and me requesting to speak with a manager I was placed on hold for 10 minutes before he came back to me, confirmed I would receive a full refund and it would be returned to my bank account within 12 days. I asked him to confirm for clarity and he did. Hours had now passed  It was a Friday evening on one of the busiest weekends in Cheltenham but we eventually managed to find a hotel for 1 night and then move to another . As we were collecting our keys at the hotel the owner contacted us. She said she had previously sent a mail with instructions but I told her I could not see it, however, Booking.com site says key collection takes place at the property.  She had no idea why Booking com stated that or why they had not provided the information. I confirmed we had now paid for a hotel. She accepted this but, according to Booking.com, she informed them we had now accessed the property. Following lengthy correspondence yesterday, I received various mails from Booking com stating they are unwilling to honour the agreement they made to refund my money as they only record their calls for training purposes so I have no proof!! My request for a senior manager to call me was refused. I was told I had to telephone the call centre and request to speak with a supervisor . I have received apologies for the way it was handled and confirmation they could have provided me with the code to access the property. They have the calls recorded for training purposes and my authority to use them but have now blocked my calls. They have always been fine for hotels but are clearly out of their depth with apartments. Please beware. If possible put your phone on speaker and have someone record it on theirs to avoid losing your money.","review_rating":1,"num_like":1,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":129,"author":"andrew hoole","location":"unknown","date":"2022-05-30T08:12:18.000Z","headline":"DONT USE THIS COMPANY!!","review_body":"DONT USE THIS COMPANY!!ALWAYS GO DIRECT TO HOTEL....TRY COMMUNICATING WHEN YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.

The company is called SoBeNY\/ trading as \u2018Corphousing Group\u2019 and the accommodation is \u2018Boston West Accommodations\u2019 in Massachusetts.We booked 7 nights at this accommodation in Boston, via Booking.com and paid in full upon booking in January 2022.Fast forward 5 months, we arrive in Boston and have our booking cancelled late afternoon, leaving us high and dry in an unfamiliar city (we are from the UK). SoBeNY and Booking.com both subsequently failed to engage, answer the phone or return messages. Since this happened to us, we have researched the Corphousing Group and found that numerous people had the same experience and Booking.com failed to take any action or remove this scam from its website. Of course, you can only write a review if you actually stay at the venue, so beware that all you will see is positive reviews for Boston West Accommodations - you are not seeing anything from those who were scammed like us. The fact that Booking.com continue to endorse this company despite knowing the problems is disgraceful.SoBeNY\/ Corphousing Group will make you feel they are legitimate and are quick to respond to messages initially. For example, I was in contact right up until arriving in Boston 3 hours prior and they said they would send us all the details and looked forward to welcoming us.As soon as we arrived at Boston and again asked for the apartment details, we received the following message from SoBeNY\/ Corphousing Group via the Booking.com messaging portal:\u201c Urgent Notification about your upcoming reservation-Thank you for your interest in staying with us. SobeNY prides itself in providing the very best experience for each of our guests. Presently we are experiencing a problem with the property and\/or listing you sought to book, and are unable to provide the experience we would have hoped to provide. We are in the midst of several software transitions to improve our guest's experience and are still working through the kinks. Unfortunately, we need to cancel your upcoming reservation. We sincerely apologize for this inconvenience.\u201dNo refund has been received and we had to pay extortionate price to stay somewhere else at late notice. Booking.com have completely failed to respond to any messages.If I had been a solo female traveller or a vulnerable person, this could have been an extremely dangerous situation.BE AWARE - BOOKING.COM IS NOT A SAFE SITE TO USE EVEN IF YOU HAVE HAD NO PREVIOUS PROBLEMS.

Considering that we live in New York, we relied on the pictures posted on Booking\u2019s website, and the perception of their quality control of properties listed on their website. We flew to Miami and went to the Apartment where we were supposed to stay for one week. Getting out of elevator, we saw a notice that the building will not have water the whole day on the following day. The corridor was under renovation and being freshly painted. The whole floor was suffocating with the smell of fresh paint. As we entered the apartment, we realized that the air conditioner is not working properly and there are notices that the air conditioner must be running all the time. There were a few stand-alone large fans located in different rooms. As I checked the kitchen, I noticed black molds in the top corner and when I paid attention I also noticed black molds around air conditioner\u2019s ducts covered by a sloppy paint job. This residence was not livable at the current condition, and the owner\u2019s disregard for the health of renters was quite astonishing. I took videos and pictures from all areas and sent them to Booking.com. Considering that one of my children has asthma, we left the apartment immediately and booked another place thru Booking. As I contacted Booking, provided all the pictures and videos, and complained they did not show any sense of responsibility for the mess they put us in. Booking did not refund us for the any of reservations, made profit twice thru two bookings we made, and did not at least apologize for their lack of reliability, and negligence. We decided that we never use Booking.com.

I've been using this hotel booking platform for years now and I never had any problems with it till now. My friends and I have booked 9 different hotels for our Euro trip this July that costed us about AED 15,000 or roughly about USD 4000 in total. One property by the name of Casa Lit Barcelona by Ona Hotels have been declining my card due to invalid credit card details. Which I have updated 3x and every time it says confirmed, then surprisingly after my 3rd attempt the booking says it was cancelled and I may need to book again. I would love to do that again if the price didn't triple the initial booking amount. We tried to send the property an email right after but no response at all. It's just funny how the other 8 bookings were confirmed except for this one hotel.Since we wanted to re-instate the booking. We tried to call their call center number and have spoken to 3 agentsThe first one was a lady who can't even construct a full English sentence, who put me on hold for 3x with 10 -20 minutes each. I asked for a Supervisor or a Manager on duty and she blatantly said we don't have one, we can't transfer you and we cant help you anymore. Until she pretended that she cant hear me and drop the call making it look that I was not there on the other line. The call lasted for an hour, give or take. After a few minutes, I called again and spoke to a guy name Kenneth. I asked him if he can give me the lady's name who I spoke with minutes back. He then put me on hold and came back saying due to security reasons he will be unable to provide the agent's name. Which was weird as they always say their names when receiving the call. I told him I need to escalate an issue and would love to speak to a Supervisor. He said unfortunately no one is available but he will look for one and put me on hold. Then the call was dropped. It was also funny for him to tell me that since this property is non refundable, we will not refund your money. Hello? my booking was canceled because my card was declined, with that being said there will be no charges or refund to be made. The call lasted for about 30 minutes.Then I called again and speak to another guy and I didn't get the name. I told him I need to speak to a Supervisor to complain, or if he can give me contact details like an email or a link to submit a complaint. He said we don't have one. He also explained that they don't have any Supervisor, and Supervisors do not speak to clients but he can take down my complaint, escalate and process it internally. Hopefully it was done. At the end nothing was done on the booking I was complaining, as they said it cannot be retrieved as the property have cancelled it. He said if I want it I may need to book it with the new price. He even offered me a EUR 20 as a goodwill gesture of the inconvenience, which I declined. I hope that the Management of booking.com sees this and investigate the issue. I am extremely disappointed and furious how these staffs have handled my concern. First the action of the property was very unprofessional and two the actions of their so called 'face of the company' or staff needs more training on how to properly assist, help and escalate customers queries or concerns.We are now thinking of canceling all the hotel bookings that we have and might use Agoda for our hotel bookings, and more likely will never use this booking app ever again.","review_rating":1,"num_like":1,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":176,"author":"Cz Cz","location":"unknown","date":"2022-05-26T13:29:42.000Z","headline":"Booking.com not genuine company at all","review_body":"No show Customer leave a fake defame review said drug den centre.

Then my husband and I decided we couldn't go - we just needed to save rather than spend. So, via the Booking.com app, I carefully cancelled the trip within the 'free cancellation' period. The App now said that the trip was 'Cancelled', and I double-checked this to be sure. I assumed (of course) that Booking.com would notify the hotel. So I was shocked and not happy when on 30th April I noticed that the hotel had taken \u00a3100 from my bank account because we hadn't arrived for our stay.Checking the app, I was also shocked to see that the Milan booking status had changed from 'Cancelled' back to 'Confirmed' - so the hotel clearly had been expecting us.Immediately I emailed the hotel to tell them that I had cancelled with Booking.com a few days ago (no reponse from the hotel) and called Booking.com to explain the situation and ask for a refund. I spoke to an agent called Ti Moni D. who said that there was a problem with the app and that I would be refunded within 24 hours. She then messaged the hotel to request a cancellation - which is the worst thing she could have done as our first night had already past, and this just made me look like a no-show rather than someone who had ALREADY cancelled via the flipping Booking.com app. I'm furious that she also made no note on my account, post our call, that she'd confirmed there was a problem with the app and promised me a refund. Very bad service. Over the next few days (and six calls I made to Booking.com, explaining things over and over to new agents -  you know how it goes) I was told by various agents that the hotel would reimburse me (it didn't - and why should it? The fault was with the Booking.com app). Meanwhile, Booking.com kept evading by insisting the hotel should pay, or by promising calls or a refund they didn't deliver).  One agent also said that I should give them proof that I had cancelled by providing their 'confirmation of cancellation' email - but I hadn't looked out for it as the app had so clearly said the booking was cancelled. I trusted this and so hadn't thought twice about it.So overall, lost \u00a3100 because of Booking.com's faulty app and bad policy, leaving me disappointed and frustrated.","review_rating":1,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":179,"author":"Micha\u0142 Skoczylas","location":"unknown","date":"2022-05-26T11:22:08.000Z","headline":"I suggest you google the facility and call them directly.

The confirmation came through which said we had booked a room and we didn't think anything of it.Arrived at the hotel, and we were told that we had been allocated a twin room by the third party that deals with booking.coms reservations, no double rooms available. So we had no choice but to take the twin room, depsite this being a romantic getaway. (The room was an absolute hole but that's another story).The following morning, we spoke to reception who said that we were welcome to check out and request a refund from booking.com for the two nights we didn't stay there on the grounds of not getting the room that we had paid for, and that they would absolutely approve the refund.We went to another hotel and paid directly (not through booking.com) and had a lovely weekend.One return I sent everything through to customer service and requested the refund. I am now about 10 email and responses later, and each email I send is responded to with more going round in circles, asking me for proof of the room type I booked (which of course is not on their confirmation, clearly done on purpose), querying the invoice, asking for a full breakdown of what i paid (including food?!) or for strange other evidence which woulnd't be appopriate. But it's all done in a weirdly friendly conversational tone. I honestly feel like I'm getting gaslighted.For the sake of my own mental health I have decided not to pursue the refund further and chalk it up to bad experience.It was almost a relief to come on here and see all the other reviews and realise that it's not just me. Also pertinent to note that there is not a single reply fro booking.com to any of their bad reviews, which I think says it all really that they just don't care.I am very lucky however that I am only down a few hundred pounds, I have read reviews on here from people who are down thousands or who had much worse expereinces. So I am counting my blessings that I have got out of this relatively unscathed.Please, please just book your hotel directly, or use a different company.

We contacted our card issuer and they told us the \u20ac48,76 (with a descripiton \"Paysend EU\") is actually returning back to our account but the \u20ac100,00 (with a description \"Wester Union\") is not.

Then 4 days before Christmas \u00a3600 came out of my bank. Which meant I had no money for the rest of of my Xmas presents. I have a two year old and hadn\u2019t even finished my Christmas shopping. This really pushed me over the edge. Whenever I spoke to booking.com they said that I booked a nine refundable room. No I DID NOT!!!!

Then a month before we went, although I had already paid the full amount another \u00a3600 came out of my bank. Despite me already paying the full amount at Christmas!!!!!!!!! This meant I went over drawn in my bank, had no money for food, petrol or anything. I got charged by my bank Every day. It took two weeks to get it back into my bank. And when I did they refunded me less because of the exchange rate. Now I cannot get back any of the money that has been missed from my bank and from the exchange rate issue. I didn\u2019t enjoy the holiday at all. And this has caused my mental health to decline. Every time I try and talk to them about it they tell me I had my refund etc etc. They are not understanding that I lost money with the exchange rate and lost money with my bank.

On May 9, we booked a room in HOTEL 21 NYC, Queens, New York for two nights (21-23 May 2022), and the reservation was confirmed. I received an email from Booking.com on the 21st May morning at 7:33 indicating that I needed to update my credit card information since it was invalid. I re-entered my credit card information and received an email from Booking.com after an hour claiming that the payment had been denied and that I needed to change my card information. This time I decided to use a different card, and the next email from Booking.com stated that the reservation had been canceled due to a credit card verification failure, and this was before the allotted time of 7 hours to provide my card details that they mentioned in the first email. When I called the hotel (HOTEL 21 NYC) about the cancellation, they said it was done by Booking.com because they couldn't verify the card details and that they might help us re-book the hotel, but at nearly double the price I had paid before (I had paid 256$ and now they were charging 572$). I was furious and decided to phone Booking.com for help. After three attempts at calling customer service, I was finally able to speak with them. When I told them the complete scenario, they stated they couldn't help me since my bank (Bank of America) had refused to release the funds. They also said that after the initial email, I should have phoned my bank to request that the amount the property is billing be released, and that they couldn't do anything because the booking had been cancelled by the property. He said he couldn't do anything when I told him the reservation had been cancelled before the scheduled time and that I am on my way from Providence and would reach the hotel in another 1 hour and could pay directly using my card. Later, he stated he would call the property and confirm my booking at the same price I had paid before after I mentioned that the property manager said it had been cancelled by Booking.com.I was placed on hold, and after a little time, he informed me that the property manager had refused to give at that price, and that I would have to find another hotel. He offered me a list of hotels which he claimed were nearby to my existing hotel and of similar pricing. However, the list he showed me was for hotels that were far away from my current booking location. I couldn't look into any further information because I didn't have time, so I booked the first option, which was a Motel 11 miles from my previous reservation (close to Jamaica). I chose Hotel NYC 21 for its location because it was close to where I needed to go for official business. To my surprise, there was no problem this time when they charged my same credit card, and I didn't even have to contact the bank.This was the pinnacle of maltreatment. At the end of the day, both parties were clearly scheming to rob and harass visitors. When I was in Germany, I used Booking.com's services and was completely satisfied.

After calling booking.com we were issued an immediate refund as they blamed \"system errors\". They knew there was a cock-up as they didn't even argue. Nonetheless, after being organised for months, it tainted the weekend and we then had to get to and from Camden, as we were no longer located where we needed to be.Booking.com also paid the additional costs for us to find another place at no notice, which I appreciate we were lucky to negotiate having read some of these reviews.

I was angry with the complexity of the property's instruction and cancelled the room (with free cancellation). The property disappear somehow and I have to contact booking.com after that, to get my money back. The first thing they said was that I should dispute it with my bank before contacting them. Imagine the audacity of scamming your customers and ask them to solve it by themselves. I tried dispute it with the bank but unsuccessful due to Visa card scheme. I contacted them again, and the only thing they did was to forward me to other person, with every person asking me to go dispute first and send them the email. I send the required documents 5 times to different person, but no one, NO ONE read it or proceed with my claim. Now I have to start the process all over again, contacting the dispute resolution center and submit everything from the beginning. I cannot believe how disgusting this company has become. Apparently they will be very nice and gentle with you when you pay, and become so so so incompetence when you ask for a refund. In short, please don't use booking.com if you don't want to deal with the absurdity of such customer service*Update 1: They disabled my account during the dispute period with out my acknowledgement. When I asked them why, they said \"Unfortunately I cannot release any data for security purposes\". I believe that is because they know I was right and I have all the neccessary documents for a refund, so they blocked me to prevent that.

The apartment manager said that, despite the accommodation being unlivable, he would only refund 40% of the price. We expected booking.com to fight the hotel for all of our money back and they have so far not bothered.

I booked a guest house in the Philippines for one night, my money was taken from Booking.com and when I turned up to the property, the property was under renovation, it had significant damage from the recent typhoon. I have a video and photo evidence of the property with the builders in there. I was told by the builders (who laughed at me when I said I have booked a night in there) that there is no way anyone can stay at the place and when they tried to call their boss, they could not get an answer. I then had to find another place to stay which cost me 5 times more. I message the property but have had no response. I called Booking.com and even they told me that they cannot get hold of anyone at the property. So, this is where the absolute joke of it all is.....  I had the phone hung up on me more than 5 times by Booking.com and only on one of the occasions did someone ring me back. I have emails stacking up and do you know what the end result is... Booking.com are telling me that I have to contact the property WHICH myself and Booking.com cannot get hold of. So basically, anyone can put a property up for rent or a room and just take your money and they actually don't exist. This scam is disgusting and the fact that Booking.com is letting it happen is a joke. Do you know Booking.com will not refund the money THEY took of me, for a property that you cannot stay in. If you google this property Dee Guesthouse White Sands and it says in black and white that they are Permanently CLOSED. I have asked for a manager and each time they tell me directly \"NO, you cannot speak to a manager\". And what is even worst, after writing this review, someone from their company should call me to help address this problem but I guarantee they will not. Now I`m going to a small claims court and will invest what ever time I have, for the sheer fact that this should not and will not happen to someone else.

We requested the owner of the property to do a late check-in between 10PM-11PM on 28th April 2022. They accepted the request. I was travelling from Calgary with my pregnant wife and senior citizen mother. Upon reaching the property around 9PM and upon talking to the owner through buzzer code he said that \u201cwe won\u2019t be able to accommodate you since we have flood in our apartment and we will issue you a full refund and have already informed booking.com AND can not help you right now\u201d. I was out of my words because I was not informed of this earlier, only a message came when I was in flight (at 8:31 PM saying that we\u2019re sorry). At that moment it was 7 degrees cold and I was stranded in a new city with my pregnant wife and senior citizen mother. I had to take care of them right away so booked a hotel (also through booking.com) and paid CAD1600 for the 3 nights. Upon reaching the hotel the first thing I did was to call booking.com. During my vacation of 3 days - I talked to 6 difference booking.com representative for total of 127 minutes after which their representative started disconnecting my calls. Booking.com representative kept taking owner's side and said the owner is denying all of this and he can not issue a refund and was always ready to accommodate you. The representative kept on repeating the same owners word and did not help us and said booking.com can not help you in this situation. I was SHOCKED!!!!!I am not that stupid that I will pay $1600 at new hotel when I already paid $1031 for a property for same duration of stay. I booked this property because I did not want to stay in a hotel and that apartment had a kitchen and a separate room for my mother, a balcony and a bigger space. I had to settle (without any of my fault) in an expensive hotel last minute in one small room without any view and no facilities. We work so hard during the weekdays to enjoy our weekend\/vacations and this is what we get - a mental torture, a vacation ruined and loss of my hard earned income.

A month before going the \"Ellerslie, Inverness\" contacted to say \"We are going on holiday, cancel your booking because tough we are not going to be there\"!Contacted Booking.com customer services and basically they don't care just book somewhere else. Of course all the prices are higher now and the best places are not available and that was the point of booking early.Then you can't give the Ellerslie a bad review. Just because I didn't go doesn't mean they don't deserve one for the very poor customer approach.","review_rating":1,"num_like":1,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":356,"author":"Robert Cooper","location":"unknown","date":"2022-05-06T15:32:41.000Z","headline":"False advertisement","review_body":"Pathetic service especially from a supposed reputable company.

The listing was not clearly indicating that. Then, even the room is not the same one as shown in the listing! It was tiny, with a double bed, big wardrobe and dressing table in a 5 sq m2 room. No space for me to move, or put luggage. I and my husband decided to leave and agreed with the landlord that he would refund me. So we left the place with trust to the landlord, and Booking customer service also ensured that they would refund me in this case. However, the landlord disappeared and ignored all my messages\/calls asking him to accept free cancellation request. I had to book another place in Paris for the same period, 5 nights. Same time, I am paying to this SCAMMER on booking, waiting for a response. At 12:00 AM the last day, the landlord cancelled my reservation, saying I did not show up. I provided proof to Booking that I did show up, and told Booking this property is a SCAM.However, after hours of calling customer service and disputing on the line, Booking insists that they could not compensate me in this case, even though I reported this as a SCAM. I am hugely disappointed with Booking. I am a Genius 3 customer and this experience destroys my trust in Booking. They know the SCAM, but they don't take any action.

One of the staff of the hotel, ended up transferring me the money from their own account as she acknowledged that the hotel has acted wrongly.

Booking offered us a solution for about the same price but a lot further from the city centre and with less comfort. They told us that we could always look for something else ourselves or get a refund. That last option was not an option since our flights could no longer be cancelled. They said that after our stay we had to inform them on the difference in price and that they would see what compensation they could offer. Because it was only three weeks before our stay, the options to choose from were very limited and prices were crazy. In the end we selected a place with less comfort (e.g. people having to sleep in the living room where in our previous booking everyone could sleep in a bedroom) but close to the city centre as that had our preference over the comfort. Instead of 500 euro the total was now 800 euro. After our stay I sent them the invoice and they said they could only offer us a refund of 40 euro because that was the price difference between our original stay and with what they had suggested. They did not mention in advance that this is how they calculate it. It is very disappointing how they have handled this. How it is possible for people to cancel your booking this close to the date without any further consequences for them by booking and how you as customer just need to accept that the stay you so much looked forward to gets overshadowed by stress.

I showed all my information where I booked my trip and they said since Booking is a 3rd party, they never received any information from them. I was livid and in disbelief. At that moment we were without a hotel and basically got conned. My wife calls the agency to explain the situation, and they said our reservation was cancelled \ud83d\ude21 without even our knowledge. We could never understand the explanation, but they said due to an over allotment. We basically got bumped, and gave to someone else at a higher price. The least they could of done was alert me, before traveling all the way from Boston.  So we were able to get the refund without issue. However, thank God the hotel manager was there to sympathize in our situation. She worked with us to give us a good deal to match what booking was offering. Thank God we were still were able to get a room for the whole week and just for the 1st night stay in an accommodating room. It all worked out and our vacation was saved. Still shame on Booking!

I am 100% certain I entered my dates correctly, as I had looked at many other locations prior to selecting Portofino. I immediately contacted booking.com via email 3 times (I've still not received a response) so I phoned customer service (after waiting 1 hour and 45 minutes on hold) and a very nice person indicated she could assist me. When she was unable to update my reservation she was puzzled and contacted a supervisor online. Her supervisor told her to let me know my reservation could not be changed or cancelled without forfeiting my $ 1745.00 down payment. How is this even possible????? The woman I spoke to repeatedly apologized for the supervisors response, but said there was nothing she could do. The rental charge came back $500 dollars higher than my quote and it was only for 6 nights! I had to scramble to find a room for one night to avoid sleeping in my car my final night. Booking.com advertises great customer service, but I experienced the absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced. The additional fees at Portofino added over $500 to my total price.

If they had let the venue know more than 24 hours before check in, the venue would have sent the money back.  It is entirely the fault of Booking.com, who had 14 1\/2 hours to let the hotel know that I wasn't coming, that I don't have my money back.

I have decided its a post lockdown knock on effect. However due to the negative experiences to date I decided to triple check a stay in NYC in Sep 2022. Hold on to your seats because you will not believe this review...So I tried to look at the hotel on Google and saw that although I had booked it via Booking.com this year, it was showing on Google as \"temporarily closed\" so as a Genius member I accessed the priority chat help and was reassured the hotel is closed but will open up again in September. They had called management who confirmed all was OK.  I asked why it was closed and no answer was given. So, I took to Google and to my suprise I find a NYC news article explaining that the city had addressed the covid homeless crisis by using hotels as crisis shelters. The Radisson Wall St being one of them...our hotel and the sticking point... it was going to remain closed till at least 2023 and continue to function as a hostel?? So again back onto chat sharing screen grabs and explaining we were going for just 5 nights to a music event and arriving late at night so I was really concerned we were going to end up with no where to stay on arrival!! An hour later we had established I was correct, the hotel is closed no plans to reopen yet it was live on booking.com as we spoke. I was so shocked and asked well what would have happened if I had not discovered this now. The second call handler tells me on arrival in NYC if I had contacted them they would have relocated me. So I explain that I now needed to be relocated, prices had risen and they needed to cover it. She spoke to her manager and he confirmed the booking had been cancelled and they would compensate me $29 for my trouble!!!!! I was shocked I had literally alerted them to the fact they were hosting a homeless shelter as a hotel on their site and that I now had to rebook elsewhere at higher prices and $29 was their \"compensation\" So I finally had a hour call with the manager who went back and fourth and when I explained had I not done my research it would be costing them at least $1000 to rebook us in somewhere else if we had arrived to no hotel for our stay. He then tells me ...actually the previous call handler was incorrect. Its not in the new COVID T&C terms that we have to help you in this situation. As the hotel is not open due to covid related change of circumstance you would have not revieved any compensation or relocation support!! This was the manager. Eventually I was offered $180 credit and that took so much pushing from my side. I had to them spend 1hr rebooking elsewhere at double the cost due to price increases since I booked. They really do not care!! So in summary..They are listing a hotel that is closed as its now a homeless shelter and yet still accepting bookings on their site.They will then not offer any support if you turn up and have no where to stay. He even told me he believes the \"hotel\" homeless shelter plans to allocate some rooms in September back to visitors via the site even though it will still predominantly be a shelter! The first agent clearly lied telling me he spoke to management at the hotel and all was good.The second agent told me we would be compensated and found new accommodation at booking.coms cost and her manager said the opposite.. All in all its a DISASTER booking site that has completely lost credability and reliability.","review_rating":1,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":405,"author":"R Ivanowa","location":"unknown","date":"2022-05-01T18:53:42.000Z","headline":"Very bad service","review_body":"Very bad service, they cancelled my fligth, without changing it....

No problem I thought - the same company so should be able to transfer my booking from one of their hotels to another. I first contacted Booking.com to explain the situation. I then discovered that my booking was not with Booking.com but with Bedsonline, a 'partner', and only Bedsonline could change the booking. Booking.com said that they could do nothing to help and I could not cancel for free as I had done in the past with Booking.com bookings.I tried to contact the hotel I was booked in but the phone just rang and rang.I then contacted Amano Reservations, explained the situation and asked if they could help. No was the answer, they said the booking was with Hotelbeds and only Hotbeds could change it. Hotelsbeds apparently owns Bedsononline. and only deal with commercial companies in the travel business not individuals. Of course none of these organisations offer the opportunity to speak to real people, it is all conducted through email which they chose to ignore.I then went back to Booking.com where I am at 'Genius Level 2' which according to their website means I am entitled to '10%\u201315% discounts applied to the price before taxes and charges Free breakfast Free room upgrade' except in this case where they offer nothing just saying that they use partners to ensure completive pricing. I checked with both hotels and could book rooms for the same price that Booking.com and its 'partner' offered.I am 75, this was my first visit to Berlin and I, my wife, my son and daughter-in-law had to manage with all the toing and froing that this mistake caused.

However, after calling 2 times a week for a month to see where my flight changes are going. Today, Air France told me that Booking.com should have a direct \"BTT\" line to call them for such matters if emails are not answered fast enough. So I asked afterwards the person at booking to call them, I was a bit rude I must admit, but after a whole months of calling back and forward to change my return flight, it really starts to get to me.I asked them to call this \"BTT\" line but the person told me it's not possible and tells me again about the email and the 24h \/ 48h waiting time. I got mad about it since I Air France just told about it !!!I got very frustrated and said \"you guys should get your thumbs out your butt and stop sending these emails and actually call them.

But I don't understand why they can't make a call when I know they have such a line.I requested change of flight... that is all. Air France told me all the different flights I could have, but unfortunately they can't do anything because I had made my reservation with booking.comBecause of all this hassel, it is the very last time I am using booking.com. Customer service is the worst I have ever experienced.*Managed to get a person who decided to call the \"BTT\" Line as mentioned above, and get a reply within an hour saying that it is Saturday and there offices are closed...I call Air France to ask about the \"BTT Line\" again, and mentioning the complaint I have with booking, i ask if these offices are closed, the person chuckles and apologises and says that no, these offices are open every day. He apologises for booking's behavior and assures me that the day before my flight if nothing has changed, Air France will then be able to change my flight.

I called the hotel the night before my arrival date and they were super nice and understanding, they cancelled my reservations without penalty fees. And because I asked about it, they also assured me that booking should not charge me also because the hotel are the ones that do that and they were not. But. A very rude rep for booking customer service told me first that I will be charged the full amount plus and extra charge for the cancellation. When I questioned him on why would they be charging me when the hotel didn't, he placed me on hold to supposedly speak to a supervisor. He then comes back and tell me that the only way I can get the reservation cancelled in their system is with a special booking cancellation code from a booking.com prepaid card which I can only get from my local store in the exact amount of the stay. And he wanted to stay on the phone with me so I do not get the wrong card. I told him I didn't see where paying for the stay to have it cancelled made sense. He then tells me that after it was cancelled in the system they would refund the prepaid card back. Now red flags hit because why do that when they can just not charge my card, after all I pay for the stay at check in. So I told him I'd call him back and I called the hotel again. And was once again met by real customer service and was told that I was not charged and will not be charged by them and there should be no reason why booking should be charging me. I called booking back and was once again met with rude, nasty unprofessional reps. We got into it about them charging me when the hotel it's and it clearly states in booking terms and conditions the, 'If you cancel a booking or don't show up, any cancellation\/no-show fee or refund will depend on the service provider's cancellation\/no-show policy'. There exact wording on there site. I was told by this horrible rep that I should have booked with the hotel and hung and I will be charged then hung up on me. I tried calling back and they will just put the call on hold without saying anything and just leave me on hold. So they must have caller ID because when I called from my daughter's phn I got an answer immediately.

I just had the worst experience with Booking I had a reservation(2892346831) at a certain price, got the confirmation email with that price only to receive a message saying there was a price error and I either have to pay more than 10x what I planned or cancel the reservation.I called the customer service, since I\u2019m working in a tourism agency I know perfectly how this type of cases should be handled: the intermediate negotiates with the hotel who assumes the impact, never affecting the client. But that\u2019s not apparently the case with Booking.I explained the case, even explained how it should be handled yet received no other solutions. When I said I accept neither canceling nor paying 10x more for an error that\u2019s not even mine, they said ok then the reservation will be canceled.

We were offered 2 alternate placebut these were further away from where we needed to be. We were told to cancel the booking. This caused us undue grief and stress at a time we were travellingto attend a funeral of a close relative. This caused additional stress to my 93 year old father who was with us so much that he was quiet and not eating or sleeping much during the stay.I feel we were fobbed off so the booking could be given to someone else. They waived the fees as the issue was their end - no electricity at the propoerty and this couldnot be rectified until next week. I feel no business would allow loss of custom for a week and would have been pressuring this issue to be fixed. I feel they had a longer booking lined up to replace us.We had to look for a property to stay. I went to book The Commissioners Quay Inn but when completing the booking process it errored stating there were no longer any rooms at the property. I found a hotel that, although expensive, was suitable in location for us to attend the funeral. This was a single room for 4 people inclusive of an old man, a woman and two men.This was uncomfortable and awkward for us all but was the only suitable place near where we needed to be - suitable in location and cost. The owners at this hotel were fantastic, we have no issues with them.I later found that the Commissioners Quay Inn had a booking for me costing \u00a3218. I cancelled but they will not waive the fee. The booking failed (it stated there were no rooms available when I attempted to complete the booking) and I was not sent any notification a booking had been made by either Booking.com or Commissioners Quay Inn. My trip was unpleasant and marred by issues with properties we booked for stay. The trip was to be unpleasant due to the reasons for travelling but it was one that should have been sadness followed by joyous remembrance. What I had was 2 nights of stress knowing that I need to find an extra \u00a3313.10 for something I should never have been charged for.Commissioners Quay Inn have refused to cancel and pocketed \u00a3218, Booking.com have pushed us to the side and pocketed their commision.

Firstly, on the day of our check in we were called 2 hours prior to our arrival asking for a \u00a3500 deposit that was not enclosed in any information or terms and conditions provided, so as you can imagine it was difficult to try and gather that amount last minute. Then as on our way to the apartment, we were called to be \u2018told\u2019 we had been swapped to a bigger apartment to accommodate our group of 8 and was this okay, meaning they had already done it, so we agreed assuming it would be the same standards as the one we had booked originally. We were also told that there was on-site security and that we needed to send photos of all of our ID\u2019s which we found to be strange. Upon our arrival we had been given a code to get a key and fob from a security key box outside that didn\u2019t work for 30 minutes and after numerous phone calls of trying to get through for support that we didn\u2019t receive, we finally had managed to get in ourselves and were unfortunately horrified at what we walked in to. Holes in the walls, grease and dirt over the walls and tables, human head and body hairs under our sheets, clean washing in the washing machine and tumble drier showing no cleaning or new sheets had been applied, utensils for food layered in grease and dust, handles missing from cupboards and doors, the shower mat was still wet in the bathroom, which leads me to say that one of the opposite neighbours had informed us that 8 Chinese men had lived there in number 48 for three days and left the morning of our arrival, as I\u2019m sure you would agree is disgusting seeming as the cleaning had clearly not been carried out afterwards. Furthermore, we had encountered a 30+ minute phone call with \u2018the receptionist at London Apartments\u2019 who was excessively rude, patronising and in no way accommodating or helpful, claiming at first he was in offices of london apartments then quickly changed his comment to \u2018working from home\u2019 so we were unable to go and resolve this in person. He gave us only one option of cancelling our reservation or forced to sleep in non-liveable conditions. When we asked for his name, occupation and information to talk to a manager the phone call suddenly went silent for a number of minutes before being cut off. Frustrating. After this, we had politely emailed them explaining we were extremely unhappy with the customer service and standards that we had been provided and would not physically be able to stay there, recording ourselves leave the key where needed and eventually leaving. We were informed our \u00a3500 damage deposit was secure during our chat to whomever taking our phone call and would be refunded when necessary. Since then we have been in contact with booking.con directly as well as our banks to request a charge back and to inform who ever it mconcerned of our traumatic experience. Just to add, we just so happened to know some friends that were in London for the same event who had booked the same apartments and entailed the exact same experience and requirements last minute, like the \u00a3500 damage deposit and last minute \u2018swap\u2019 of rooms but were unfortunately in a situation that meant they had no choice but to stay there. Any extra information you require to help us further can be provided like photo and video evidence with exact timings and dates. The specific assistance we\u2019re hoping for is a full refund of \u00a3912 on our original booking with this property and full refund of the \u00a3500 deposit which was paid on our day of arrival. The property was not up to standard and looked nothing like the pictures they have provided on booking.com, in addition, upon entering the property it was clear that it had NOT been cleaned from the previous guests - we have taken photos to prove this. As a website that provides a service to the public I\u2019m sure you\u2019re already aware that this is false advertisement  and legally can be reported to the trading standards office as this is breaking marketing and advertising laws. The property did not make us feel safe and secure which is a basic necessity for a guest, as a group of a young girls this made us feel uneasy. Upon ringing to complain about the the property and how we had quite clearly been deceived by false marketing and advertisement the \u201cmanager\u201d was very rude, extremely unreasonable and all around unhelpful and was more than happy to see a group of young girls 4 hours away from home stuck with no where to stay. Overall, this was a very distressing and upsetting experience.AVOID USING BOOKING.COM AND DO NOT BOOK LONDON EXCEL APARTMENTS.

Under is my review for the apartment so you can understand. Negative review for booking.com because my case is crystal clear the company wasn't honesty, ignore all my contacts leaving me without solutions, a lot of bed reviews with similar problems on internet and they take the property side, on the thousands phone call to them people just say \"When the property do not want refund a costumer we can't do nothing\"So you book with them, pay by their website but when need fix the problem they get out of the situation... Very convenient. The worse platform you can use for book.Booked one apartment in Preston for 5 Nights, Reservation number (2208.805.875) arrived everything looks ok, apartment not bad, nothing special, a little dark and closed ( No window in the Kitchen, Bathroom and corridor.) but still not bad, until my arrive they answer very fast, kind and helpful. Just arrived I realize that my mobile phone dosnt work and it's absolutly necessary for my job... Very kind I sent message to them asking if they know which operator works in that house and the answer was \"You can use wifi.\" But big companys do not speak with their costumer by whatsapp, for example booking.com do not have a whatsapp number to speak with them, you need phone signal, same for the company I work... I in very kind way trying to fix the problem, I bought 2 new sim cards of 2 different operators. No signal at all even next to the window, so I sent a new message to them with picture of sim cards and the screen of my phone with 0 Signal, asking if they can change for another apartment (I saw they had one in the same building) or charge me for 1 night and refund my other nights, they answerd \"We will speak with our team and contact you soon,\"after 3 hours nobody contact me, I need my number with signal for my work, stay hours without mobile phone signal gave me anxiety, Without any answer I decide contact Booking, they were unsuccessful in talking to the people in charge.. Then I explain everything to booking.com let they know that I was putting the keys on the their letter box and leave, days past and they never answer about my last message. After one week and with a lot of contact with Booking.com, they refuse charge me for 1 night and  me my refund, even having only stayed a few hours, crystal clear that the problem was in their property, they do not fixed the probelm with me, actually don't even answered, and booking.com has been in their side. They are the kind of people that don't care about be honesty, about service to the costumer or fix problems, they want take your money and don't even answer you for fix problem of their apartment. So I hope with this review people do not rent this apartment, Please dont give your money for people like this they don't deserve. I book very often using booking.com and It's my first negative reviewn. I hope the money they take from me, they can lost x100 cause this review, its a trully review, I will review them in another 2 famous websites and put pictures with proof of whats happen.I with my all travel experience do not advice this place even for my enemi .

We have so far spent over 11 hours now being tossed between booking.com and airlines because of a covid impacted cancellation by one of the airlines meaning we couldn't fly to our destination.

I had one service representative accidentally drop the phone and hang up the call, another transferred me to a dead end line. I've talked to several other representatives that were friendly enough, but seemingly without any ability to help. To compound the issue, we booked this over the phone and they put my middle name down as my first name only, and so the airline is telling me there are issues that only booking.com can resolve... I understand that changes make things difficult and that this is a tough time for all airlines\/travel agents, but no one at booking.com seems to have the authority or willingness to try to help, they all just point to someone else resulting in literal hours of waiting to talk to another representative. I'd say they make the booking process easy, but if you need to make a change even if a covid impacted cancellation (which is common these days unfortunately...) through no fault of your own, then you are going to spend a ridiculous amount of time on the phone and get nowhere.

I booked an apartment with a kitchen, 4 months in advance for a friend 50th bday surprise who was flying in from out of state! I had a question about the kitchen utensils. I tried contacting the unit owner by phone but phone number was a non working number. I contacted booking.com  customer service and was told that they will get back to me in a week. No one contacted me so I called and I was told that they were unable to reach the unit owner and they will seek help of a supervisor and get back to me. Once again I called back and was reassured that all was okay bc this unit is booked for weeks and no complaints listed. I soon found out that the unit was in a gated community yet no apartment or contact person was given to me with my booking. I reached out to booking.com again and was told that I had to wait until my booking date and time and if upon my arrival,  I should have issues, call them and I will be provided with similar accommodations within 30 mins!!!! 3 times on 3 different occasions I was told this in the 4 month period . What an embarrassing, frustrating and expensive nightmare this turned out to be to me and my friends whom I had picked up at the airport. \ud83d\ude16\ud83d\ude23Needless to say we Did Not Get In and I couldn\u2019t get any agent to speak to for almost 40 mins. All we got was the ring around auto message of pressing buttons that took us nowhere !!! We all tried calling! Twice I was hung up on without speaking to someone. Each person thereafter passed u on to another and another. I kept explaining that they should read the notes left by previous agents but they all took the easy way out and passed u on to someone else. We repeatedly asked for a supervisor but was told not one was available in the 4 hours of dealing with these incompetent agents with a language barrier of I could only say from India. Now fully frustrated, hungry, and tired after traveling out of state for 3 hours and having frozen food defrosting, we found out that my original booking was cancelled! Cancelled without telling me!!! After our 10th, 11th or 12th agent , they had the nerve to ask me to call back and have another agent make similar accommodations for me but I will have to pay the difference!!!! ! What a freaking, frustrating, fudging  nightmare. Run people run\u2026. Far away from booking.com.  Never again will I use Booking.com and I ask all of you to beware!!!! Our booking was at 4pm, and at around 9pm we just gave up because the agent that finally tried to help us booked us into a god forsaken area we would never have chosen for ourselves!!! What is the purpose of booking 4 months in advance to get a deal and now having to pay through your A\u2014\u2014 for a similar place with present price?? Half a star to the last agent! He said he had daughters and won\u2019t want them stranded at night. We went back to my tiny apartment heartbroken, hungry and totally depleted for fun because of don\u2019t care agents that work for booking.com. Their unprofessionalism and lack of sympathy and empathy totally  RUINED the 50th bday surprise, ruined our plans for some relaxation and fun and just ruined hard earned vacation time planned in advance.

After that I was NOT able to get his credit card detail, even I am sure his credit card has been validated by Booking.com.

So, I did a phone call to the customer service again on 8th of April, the CS confirm with me that reservation was cancelled by booking.com, not me, not guest.

I was told to call the airlines to change the date, but the airline stated my only option was to cancel the booking all together and rebook for the correct dates. I called booking.com to let them know the airline couldn\u2019t change my dates unless I cancelled everything and started over. I was told no, you will be reimbursed because you have a flexible ticket. Booking.com was not able to modify my dates themselves, which makes no sense if they offer flexible ticket options but can\u2019t do anything to modify them. I was told to look online and see what the cost of the ticket for the date I wanted is, while I was still on the line with the booking.com employee. Why I had to look up ticket pricing for them, I have no idea. I gave them the price from the airline\u2019s website, and was told that I would be refunded the price of my return flight so it would balance out. I was told to go ahead and purchase the new plane tickets with my new return date, and then I\u2019d get a refund. I asked the employee where do I buy the ticket? Through the airline or through booking.com again, and he responded it didn\u2019t matter where I book the ticket, I\u2019ll get my refund. So I booked through the booking.com app again since I was told it didn\u2019t matter, and it was cheaper than the airline website. A week later I still have no refund, so I call to check the status. I am then told they have a policy that any changes to the reservations have to be done through the airline to get a refund. I asked them why did their colleague tell me it didn\u2019t matter where the ticket is purchased, if they have a policy about it?! That\u2019s exactly why I asked where to buy the ticket, so there wouldn\u2019t be any problems. I called booking.com 3 times, and was on the line for 45 minutes so they could help me figure out how to change the date on my flexible airplane tickets, just to be told wrong information. Unbelievable!! Now, my case has been sent up through their department to be reviewed and I will be contacted in 24 hours to let me know if I\u2019ll get my refund or not. Absolutely ridiculous!!! I shouldn\u2019t be penalized because their colleague told me incorrect information. What\u2019s the point of paying extra for flexible tickets if they can\u2019t even help with any changes?

Unfortunately I am disappointed with Booking.com through which we made the booking!  The reason is as follows:We booked in Dubai the hotel Millenium Place for 2 adults and 3 children through Booking.com, knowing also that our 14 and 12 year old children count as adults in UAE and our 10 year old daughter as a child. So we booked 2 rooms, one for 3 people and one for 2 people! All good until we arrived at the hotel, there were only 4 beds in the rooms. When I asked at the reception for another bed, we should pay 600 AED in addition to the booking for the child. We booked and paid for 5 people at Booking.com and then had to pay on top of that! This is in my eyes a rip-off of Booking.com and would like to complain to Booking.com. The hotel (especially Mr. Hamza) was very nice, professional and accommodated me by instead of the 600 AED only 400 AED to pay and gave us then also for the children a suite, because in this room was more space for another bed. Unfortunately, the bitter aftertaste remains that I was ripped off here by BOOKING.COM and I unfortunately had to pay on it. Too bad, I believed that Booking.com is correct!

However last night I received an email confirming a booking for a holiday in Poland.  This was somewhat of a surprise as I never made any such booking.  I checked the email address of the sender in case it was a scam and it was from Booking.com.  However just in case the senders email address had been spoofed I logged in to my Booking.com account separately (not using any links etc).To my astonishment there was indeed a booking for 2 adults for 5 nights in KoloBrzeg.  I then received an email from Apartameny Proeko Polonia (via Booking.com) confirming the booking but the guest name was not mine.  At this point I tried to find a phone number to contact Booking.com on but as others have stated this just ends up in the customer going around in a circle on their website.I do not know if this was a scam or if someone else had made a genuine booking and Booking.com\u2019s system had mistakenly allocated it to an account different to the person creating the booking.  However I have cancelled the booking and taken screenshots of the cancellation.  I have retained all emails including confirmation of the cancellation from Booking.com and Apartameny Proeko Polonia in case they are required if there is any dispute about this in the future.Luckily I did not have any credit\/debit card details stored on Booking.com\u2019s website.  I have never had any reason to contact Booking.com in all the years I have used them but I was shocked at how difficult they make for customers to speak to\/or email them directly.I was surprised when I came to Trustpilot to check if others had had a similar experience to see how far Booking.com\u2019s ratings have fallen.

I booked an apartment in the centre of Paris, many months ago, for what turned out to be a major rugby weekend.  We had the street address but the flat number was only going to be provided on the day or arrival along with an entry PIN code.  At around 5am on the Friday morning, I received an email from the property to tell me my credit card details were incorrect and that if I did not update them within 6 hours, my booking would be cancelled.  It seemed odd, but I updated them anyway and received an email saying that the update was successful.  then around 3pm I received another email telling me that my booking had been cancelled because my card details were incorrect.  I called the property, who told me that the booking had been cancelled, they could not tell me by whom, that I needed to rebook for another time (clearly not a sensible response) and to speak to Booking.com.  I suggested that the property would be free, that I had my card and was ready to pay, but they showed no interest in a solution.  I called Booking.com and spoke to someone who struggled to understand the situation and said I should speak to the property - I told them that I had and that they had pointed me to Booking.com.  After insisting that Booking.com helped me to find a resolution the Customer Services rep agreed to call the property and to call me back.  Half an hour later I got an email from someone else in Customer Services saying they had not been able to call the property - which was odd, as I had managed to do so.  It is clear to me that the property chose to cancel my booking - they are able to do so because the Ts and Cs state that effecting payment correctly is my obligation and so it is easy for them to hide behind the excuse that the details are incorrect even if not (I even had to upload a picture of my credit card a few weeks ago which feels like bad practice) - and to sell those nights to a higher paying customer for the rugby weekend.I had to find 2 nights accommodation at last minute for 4 people and to pay significant transport costs to continue our weekend as planned.  I will be looking to recover those costs from Booking.com.I recommend that (1) the property provider is removed immediately from your platform (2) all properties are required to provide FULL address details at the time of booking (3) there is a reverse cancellation charge imposed on properties who cancel, just as there is for customers (4) payment details are confirmed (by both sides) well in advance (5) my excess costs are reimbursed by Booking.com who can pursue the property for those costs.","review_rating":1,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":782,"author":"naseem ali","location":"unknown","date":"2022-03-21T09:32:00.000Z","headline":"Very bad service even occupied your\u2026","review_body":"Very bad service even occupied your many don\u2019t book with this company booking.com only website they don\u2019t have any responsibilities your booking.and look has email which he sending me.

The customer service is shockingly poor regardless of whether or not you are a loyal customer. If you need to book via booking.com please be vigilant when making payment and utilise the pay later options if available as they will take your money without providing the service!I completed a booking at \u2018Foundry Luxury Apartments\u2019 in Luton, a month in advance of the date I intended to stay and received no communication from the host or booking.com advising that there were any issues. I travelled to my destination on a day where there was heavy traffic and issues on the motorway so I made sure to contact the host when I was at least 30 mins away but received no response. Upon arrival, I called the number for the property provided on the booking.com app to make a query about gaining access and was referred to the manager. I attempted to call the manager 3 times with no luck but immediately after the 3rd attempt I received a text stating that there is a plumbing issue and that I would need to cancel my stay. This was evidently a lie as I was parked outside the building and could see a number of people entering and exiting so there were clearly people staying there. I reported this to booking.com and they advised me to give the host 30mins to provide me alternative accommodation, however this did not happen and the host was very rude and unprofessional telling me that there is over 100 properties in Luton on Booking.com and I should look. I went back to Booking.com and advised that I needed somewhere to stay that night and as I had already made full payment, requested for this amount to be transferred to another reservation or in the form of credit to enable me to book elsewhere without further inconvenience. However, they advised that they are unable to fulfil this request and that I must pay for alternative accommodation and request a refund of the difference up to \u00a360 once I have completed my stay although they are fully aware that there would be a surge in prices due to the short notice. After almost 2 hours of going back and forth, the customer advisor disclosed that the host stated that there were supposed damages when I had stayed previously. This is most certainly not the case as I always take precaution wherever I stay and take images of all damages upon arrival as these hosts cannot be trusted! If this was also true then my booking would not have been confirmed when it was booked a month prior.After waiting for hours, I was not able to find an alternative and made my way back home. Booking.com have not provided any form of compensation or good will for this experience and as a result have lost a loyal customer!","review_rating":1,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":791,"author":"Chantel Davis","location":"unknown","date":"2022-03-19T17:31:16.000Z","headline":"Booking.com no complaints procedure","review_body":"HelloI have a complaint and am having no joy getting it properly reviewed.

When i booked, it was mentioned in the cancellation options that it is non refundable and i can change my dates of stay only one time. When my flight ticket changed, i contacted the hotel through booking but no reply from them. I then contacted booking to change my dates of stay then they told me nothing about the terms were mentioned in my reservations. So i screenshot my reservations page and send to them, only then they tried to help me by contacting the hotel on behalf of me. While waiting for that, the hotel replied to me through booking chat that i can request for the change at the website, which was not possible because booking's system itself prohibit me to do so. so i contacted booking multiple times until they told me that the hotel did not allow me so. I did try to call the hotel myself, but it never get through, always no one's available to answer my call. So believing that lie, i booked the new dates directly at the website which is suprisingly much cheaper, and has free cancellation until may. When i checked in the hotel, i asked them why i cannot change my dates online, they said it's booking's problem. it's a 5 star hotel, so i don't think they're lying. so i'll never book with booking.com again cause it's a scam.","review_rating":1,"num_like":3,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":850,"author":"Curt Mikkelsen","location":"unknown","date":"2022-03-13T03:29:16.000Z","headline":"Horrible experience","review_body":"Horrible experience.

On our journey down on the day of booking in, the hotel informed us that they would have to cancel due to broken boiler. On contacting Booking.com they informed us we would have to wait 24hrs before they could do anymore. Therefore more or less being told to sleep on the streets until they had spoken to the Hotel over the cancellation. Found another hotel which was now more expensive due to short notice. Next day contacted Booking.com again for any news on my refund, whilst I traveled to the hotel who had to cancel my booking. Booking.com informed me whilst I was stood in the hotels reception that they had tried again to contact the hotel, which they had no reply !!!! I then informed Booking.com I was stood in the hotel who cancelled and no phone was ringing whilst I was there. Then very quickly the phone rang, with the hotel informed Booking.com that they had cancelled. I have now received a refund. Never again will I book through a company who lied about there escalation process on recovery of refunds, expecting a couple, with a disabled partner to more or less sleep on the streets, until they waited 24hrs for a response from a hotel, in which they did not even contact in the first place.

After a lot of effort to get it sorted out I received a message that I have to contact them after my stay to get that missing discount refunded (about 55EUR). Now they don't respond to customer support chat or email and have blocked me on Facebook too. I don't plan on calling them, because it is an added value number, but no info on what it costs. Also a lot of people say phone calls are often ended by customer support or they just don't want to help.I've had another bad experience with them some years ago. A booking was changed on the day of arrival with a lower quality place. I got no refund, no option to leave a review (not that it matters, because I've had reviews removed from the site before) and because of a super narrow road (Italy) to that new place I got the rental car damaged for which I paid 450EUR, luckily I had an insurance which covered it.Booking.com cares about taking your money, but nothing else. A lot of property owners also complain online about this company.Next time I need to book a place, I will look for a better service or contact the property directly.UPDATEI like to be fair, so here is what happened after my review. My comment on Facebook did appear after a few days. It was probably held for review by them. I finally did get a refund as they promised too. It took over 4 days to get any response after contacting them in many different ways. Then it took a few more days to get the refund in their system as credit and after that a few more days to get it back in my bank account for which the bank charged me with 1% fee. Customer service is just too slow and if it is urgent, you can forget about it. That is why I leave my rating at 1 star.","review_rating":1,"num_like":1,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":887,"author":"Marco Valle","location":"unknown","date":"2022-03-08T09:44:42.000Z","headline":"Don\u2019t use Booking.com","review_body":"I couldn\u2019t travel to Miami because BA cancelled my flight.

They said we  could either cancel the booking or stay at the Prince of Wales Hotel instead. This was clearly done at deliberately late notice such that it gave us NO CHOICE but to stay at the Prince of Wales Hotel. We did not have any time to find alternative accommodation and simply had no choice to stay there, despite the Prince of Wales Hotel having considerably inferior ratings. Furthermore, we were promised an equivalent room in the Prince of Wales Hotel and it was completely inadequate. The room was dark and dingy and did not even have any windows. Absolutely horrible. We were told we would receive the same terms that had been agreed with Royal Clifton Hotel, but this was NOT the case. Our original booking included free Wifi but we were told we had to pay an additional daily rate to use Wifi in Prince of Wales Hotel. Finally, despite dogs apparently being welcome in Royal Clifton Hotel, we were forced to pay AN EXTRA charge in order for our dog to stay us.

Then when you arrive and have been completely mis sold the hotel booking.com refuses to reimburse you. My partner booked a hotel for part of our holiday in Mexico. The hotel transpired to be a health hazard as the rooms smelt strongly of mould. Even the pillow on my bed was mouldy (I will include pictures in due course). The rooms had concrete floors which were dusty and you could not shower in privacy as a mesh window in the bathroom revealed your nudity to the other hotel guests. There was also no hot water in the bathroom to actually shower with. Once at the hotel and realising that we were not getting what we paid for, we read some horrendous google reviews which explained we were never getting our money refunded from the staff at the hotel who always advise unhappy customers that they need to contact their agent. I explained to the staff that we knew they were going to say that to us and that if we went to booking.com, they would advise us to get a refund from the hotel. Both booking.com and the owners of this establishment have 0 integrity and are using each other to get away with scamming some of their customers. Booking.com should take responsibility for ensuring that the hotels are accurately represented on their website. I would not use booking.com or if you do only book a place for a single night. We had to lose 4 nights of money when we were treating to 15 year old children to a holiday after the difficulties of the past two years. We then had to use valuable time up from our holiday to go and find alternative accommodation. All boolking.com offered us was a good will gesture of $56.

I would guess if you are the person who is booking the hotel and going to pay for it, booking.com is okay...but if you are booking the room for a friend and it's not you...it's nothing but a SCAM SCAM SCAM.  When you reserve the room and you give the persons name and email address you are booking and giving your card number and paying for it and usually your card company will contact you and approve the transaction because you believe you are paying for the room...BUT NO YOU ARE NOT PAYING FOR THE ROOM... THE PERSON NEEDS THE ACTUAL CREDIT CARD  YOU USED TO BOOK THE ROOM TO BE ON THEM AT THE HOTEL..   So when my friend went into the hotel to sleep..and she expected it to be paid in full, they said no..YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE CREDIT CARD THAT WAS USED ON BOOKING.COM.   And who is going to have the credit card when a Friend in USA did the booking?  I'm sure when you are doing the booking somewhere there is small print notifying you that THE PERSON CHECKING INTO THE ROOM NEEDS THE CREDIT CARD USED ON BOOKING.COM.  When they don't produce the card..the hotel Jacks up the price  30% or whatever..so this IS A TOTAL SCAM.  TOTAL STRESS FOR THE PERSON AT THE HOTEL..TOTAL RAPE JOB OF HIGHER $$$.  What they also did was do a double booking .. I only did the booking 1 time but the guy at the hotel said there was a double booking for the same person..2 room..  THEY ARE A TOTAL JOKE.  So I called booking.com and they wanted me to download an app to my phone to cancel the booking.  I asked cannot you just cancel the booking?  You have my name and phone number i used to book and i'm calling from the same phone...but NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO You must down load the app.??? I'm thinking of last one who told me to down load to my computer and it went dead...and I get a call for ransom to fix it...  THESE PEOPLE ARE EVIL SCAMMERS AND THEY KNOW THEY ARE SCAMMERS...DO NOT USE... EXCEPT IF IT'S YOU WHO IS SHOWING UP TO USE THE ROOM..AND YOU HAVE THE CARD YOU USED FOR THE BOOKING..THEN I AM NOT SURE IF PROBLEMS.  BUT IF YOU ARE BOOKING FOR ANOTHER.. YOU ARE THROWING AWAY $$ AND GETTING SCAMMED...CANCELY YHOUR CARD AND CALL AND REPORT THE SCAM.  The worse this is you are using this service to help a friend out who is stuck in another country or state and you believe you are paying for the hotel when you hit the reserve and they have all your credit card info...but when the desperate person walks into the hotel..they tell her..OH YOU MUST HAVE THE CREDIT CARD USED FOR THE TRANSACTION OR THERE IS NO BOOKING..

We booked through these for a 3 night stay at a house. When we arrived at around 8pm after driving for 3 hours with 3 children, we were told the place had cancelled. They offered one solution that was a further 25 minutes away from were we needed. When contacted by booking. Com they informed us that they would try to find somewhere else but we would have to pay first then be refunded the difference. After over 2hrs conversation no place could be found that was available that night and getting through to a supervisor was extremely hard. Finally thr supervisor said they would have the customer service continue to find us somewhere. The result was they still didn't find anywhere and we ended up sleeping in the car. This was 2 adults and 3 children. At 1.30 in the morning they send us a place to see if it was available it wasn't till the next day. We managed to find somewhere the for the next 2 night but had to sleep in 3 separate rooms. In the morning we had nowhere to wash or get changed and nowhere to make breakfast so had to buy a Mcdonald breakfast before my son had to get changed in a toilet because he had a competition at 10.00 that day. We couldn't check into the hotel till 2 so had to but convenience food to eat. When we checked in the menu was expensive to feed 5 and we had already had to borrow money to pay the hotel, so we had to buy more convienience food to eat that night and for the next day. We were told via communication with booking .com that they would look into refunding us this extra money and will look into compensation for our inconvenience. After returning home and sending the receipts we heard nothing back from them even after emailing them, so we contacted them. The seniors refused to speak to us and told the customer service person to tell is they will only refund us the petrol and the extra we paid on the hotel, even though we paid for 3 nights and only received 2.

Unable to get home I made the above reservation. I paid in full prior to checking in. On checking in the staff asked for a pre-authorisation of \u00a325. It's very rare a hotel asks me for a pre-authorisation if I've pre-paid. On the occasions they do, this is only in case of any extras. In the past I have always explained I won't be charging to my room and if I do I'll pay cash. This has been entirely satisfactory for every hotel I've ever stayed in, until last night.Drakes hotel refused to allow me to stay without this pre-authorisation. No-where in the booking process did you explain that Drakes will only accept a stay with a pre-authorisation. If you had specified this, I would not have chosen Drakes. Having paid for the room prior to check-in, I didn't have \u00a325 left in my bank account to pre-authorise even if I'd agreed to. I only had a small quantity of cash on my person.So, late in the evening, with no way of getting home due to the trains having left, I was unable to access the hotel room I had paid for. By this point my 'phone was also on about 5% battery.Your staff were unwilling to do anything practical to assist me, such as making an alternative booking. Because you did not specify that a pre-authorisation was an absolute pre-condition of staying at Drakes, I paid for a hotel room I couldn't access, leaving me with insufficient funds to make an alternative booking.I was left without accommodation, on my own, in winter, overnight. I only had a shirt and blazer on, no coat. As my 'phone had run out of battery I was unable to contact friends or family to assist. I have bouts of sciatica due to my lower back sometimes being out of alignment. The cold can aggravate this and waiting all night until the trains re-started in the morning made my back particularly uncomfortable.Due to you not making me aware of Drakes' policy prior to paying, I was left without accommodation. You had the opportunity to help me find a solution, but you didn't, leaving me literally out in the cold all night in an unfamiliar town.My safety, and general health were put at risk. I could have been mugged, or otherwise attacked. What if a young woman had been in my position? Is this something Booking.com would be comfortable with? I am exceptionally unhappy and have serious concerns about your approach to guest safety in circumstances such as these. As things stand, I believe it could be in the public's interest to be aware of your approach. If I had a young daughter, I would be advising her to avoid your booking service because of these risks.I am looking for this problem to be corrected, and indeed for you to make restitution to me. I am giving you the chance to make this right. If you fail to see the importance of what happened last night, and don't make things better for me, then I will regard this as being a case it is in the public's interest to hear about. To that end I would write to the national press and relevant holiday and travel publications. I'm hoping I won't have to do that and I'm confident you will make this situation right for me.Yours sincerely,Mike ...'As things stand, I'll never use them again.","review_rating":1,"num_like":1,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":987,"author":"Zion Village","location":"unknown","date":"2022-02-22T16:44:31.000Z","headline":"Total incompentence.","review_body":"I have never seen or heard from a more incompentent customer service department than Booking.com's!

This was the biggest mistake I could make. Booking.com really doesn't care about individuals.I am being charged an illegal commission by booking.com repeatedly. The guest in question is a confirmed fraud by Booking.com. (I was given this information on the phone.) He apparently only books to block the dates of a property, never showed up, never cancelled, never paid. This booking was a NO SHOW. I HAVE NOT CHARGED THIS FRAUDULENT PERSON, NEITHER HAVE I RECEIVED ANY PAYMENTS. September 2021, I reported this guest and alerted booking.com that he was using different names on the platform, with the same message, phone number and pictures. I have been informed through the phone that, this was never picked up due to a glitch in the system. Also, was informed that all the other messages I sent afterwards were just ignored and marked as \"no actions required\". Why would I continuously send messages if no action is required?? Make it make sense please.. Honestly, this company is very incompetent and the customer service is the worst. All the evidence and proof is with Booking.com. Everything shows this commission is not correct, in order to waive the commission. I have called several times without any real form of help, cause apparently the customer service on the phone can't assist me. It's only the Finance department that can help, which is not reachable through phone only by message. THE FINANCE DEPARTMENT DOESN'T EVEN READ OR REPLY THESE MESSAGES. The situation is being prolonged for no reason. It's frustrating.Booking.com has acknowledged their mistake on phone numerous times, however absolutely nothing is being done to resolve the problem.We are in February 2022 now, and my request has not been resolved. Rather, Booking.com is sending me mails that they are going to take legal actions against me if I do not pay the commission.

They do provide a service but they do fraud as well - they sometimes charge you twice for your bookings and I am still fighting since 2018 to get my money refunded for being charged twice. Recommendation - stay away from this company and use other booking companies - there is a lot of competition.This is from my own experience in 2018: I have reserved and PAID directly via booking.com for the hotel (visible on my Paypal and Credit Card company summary). Once I've arrived at the hotel, the booking was there, but the Hotel said I have to pay as it's not being shown as paid - I said it should be, but I paid for the moment and decided to check that after my vacation. And so I did a couple of months later and found out that indeed I had been charged twice the same amoubt of money once as said via Paypal and Credit Card Company and the second time from my bank card on the day of checking in. I have been in contact with the hotel - they have required me to provide all the details - even though they do have all the details in their system and can see it all there, but I did provide everything again - no response after that - ever. Now I have been in contact with Booking.com hoping for a better experience - I forwarded them our emails with the hotel to booking.com - no response. After a few days I have asked if they have already found something out - they replied to me that they need more details on the hotel\/date, etc - even though all of that information was already in the forwarded email. So I did add the details as they requested - then no response again for a long time. I wrote them again but still haven't received any response.If they can't resolve this in the next few days I will have to report them to the police. This is not what you would expect from a good company - a good company should resolve this for the customer without him having to do anything about this and not try to wait for ages so that the customer forgets - this indeed just shows that the company is a fraudulent company and is probably making millions of extra profit by scamming their customers like this (obviously from each hotel booking they only get some percentage, but if they charge you twice, they get a whole lot of profit).","review_rating":1,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":1033,"author":"Gabi","location":"unknown","date":"2022-02-17T10:27:55.000Z","headline":"Terrible!","review_body":"Used to have a good customer service, but now they just don't care any more, they hire people that don't even speak the language and they do nothing but shifting the blame for their mistakes.","review_rating":1,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":1034,"author":"Renato Farias","location":"unknown","date":"2022-02-16T23:40:47.000Z","headline":"Booking.com totally neglectful and witness of a conjob.","review_body":"I booked an Apartment named \"City Center Apartment\" in Bergen, Norway via booking.com, One day before check-in I got a message from the host saying the code to get keys would be sent by 15:00 next (date and time of check-in), They didn't sent the code then I called them, a man answered the phone saying the code will be sent in 1 minute, then he sent 15m past check-time, so far no big issues.When we (Me, my wife and my child) entered in the apartment we found something was really wrong, the washing machine was washing someone else clothes, the sofa leg was broken, doors from cabinet and wardrobes war broken, windows didn't lock (Norway in the winter) and the hot water was not working.

I wanted to switch rental car providers on the day of pickup, and I spoke with a very helpful and pleasant agent on the phone who made me a new booking and canceled my other one for a full refund. When I got the email confirmation though, the new booking was booked for Milan Linate Airport although I asked for Milan Malpensa Airport. Honest mistake, so I called back and asked for the same customer service representative as he was so helpful. They looked up who helped me with that booking and transferred me to him. He then apologized and admitted it was his fault and corrected it. He noted that it would be a roughly 10 EUR additional charge for the difference in price, which I was fine with. My next booking was correct, for Milan Malpensa Airport. Everything was great on the trip, and I was very satisfied with the service.Fast forward to after my trip, I saw that I had a 50 EUR charge on my card for a cancellation. I knew the first booking didn't have a cancellation fee, and I found out after talking to Booking.com that it was the mistaken booking at Linate Airport that the customer service representative on the phone booked for me that had a cancellation charge when he moved it to Malpensa Airport. The service rep hadn't mentioned any cancellation charge that would apply, and plus I don't see why I should be liable for a cancellation fee for a booking that I didn't ask for (I clearly asked for Malpensa Airport, and the agent made the mistake). I have since talked to 6 different people at Booking.com. On the phone they said they are not allowed to handle these kinds of refund questions, so they directed me to file the complaint online. I filed the complaint online on January 14. After two weeks of radio silence, someone finally responded and told me that I was mistaken and no customer service representative helped me on the phone and that I had made the changes myself online and that therefore the cancellation fee is correct. Odd, considering I think I would know if I called customer service and had these two conversations with them... and when I called back the second time the agent I got was able to easily look up in their system who had helped me before, and transfer me back to him!  So I know this information is in their system. Anyway, I was getting nowhere with the rep on email because he never responded to my first response back. Then I tried chatting on Booking.com and they also said they weren't able to help and that I needed to email this other email. The rep on chat also confirmed in writing that this was a mistake on Booking.com's part but that I had to go through e-mail. So I emailed the new email address, got one response asking me to confirm my identity as the main driver, and never heard from them again!  I have emailed 3 times over the past week and a half with absolute radio silence.This honestly feels like a strategy that Booking.com is employing to confuse and draw out the process until I get frustrated and give up. Terribly poor customer service via e-mail for refunds. I've never experienced anything like it before (where over a month goes by trying to get an issue resolved) which is why I have drawn the conclusion that this is a deliberate tactic. I do not recommend this company. Booking.com also should start allowing all their customer service reps via phone and chat to help solve customer problems.","review_rating":1,"num_like":1,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":1042,"author":"patrick clifford","location":"unknown","date":"2022-02-16T01:33:46.000Z","headline":"cockroaches, prostitutes, fraud.","review_body":"I booked a room with them, it had cockroaches and prostitution was happening in the lobby.

Toilet is very tiny, as the sink was tiny, couldn't even wash face properly. What's the point of having a sink if it's not fit for purpose? Router was in the room but no WIFI password, too hot. Kettle and tea bags were in the room however no coffee or sugar were provided. One cup was provided for 2 guests. very dissappointed. wont be stgaying here again\".

Just FYI - we never had anything to eat there, neither we made any mess. The above accusations were completely false. I have straight away made a complaint to Booking.com. As they were able to see my review as well as the racist comment from the property, they told me that this would be investigated. I didn't hear anything from Booking.com for nearly 3 weeks, hence I contacted them to check on the progress of my complaint. All I've been told that they have reported the property for the abusive behaviour towards me and they could offer me \u20ac25 (not even \u00a3) as a good will to use it against to my future booking.

The owner of the property contacted me, via Booking.com\u2019s platform, the day before arrival and demanded an additional \u00a3850 \u2018fully refundable security deposit\u2019. I contacted booking.com for advice and they told me they had checked all reviews and everything was positive and I could trust the proprietor. They advised me to proceed with the payment (which was via a bank transfer, hence my concern). On the day of arrival, the owner cancelled the booking a few minutes before the check in time, claiming the property had been \u2018trashed\u2019 by a previous occupant. My children and I were stranded in London with no accommodation (not the fault of BDC). For a few weeks I went back and forth with the owner on BDC\u2019s platform trying to secure the \u00a3850 refund - to no avail. When I involved the police and a lawyer, BDC volunteered to take over and resolve it for me. They removed the site listing and all trace of the conversations between me and the owner. They tried to secure a refund from the owner and when this failed, they wrote to me to say they would refund me and then take action against the owner to reclaim their money. They asked me to provide evidence - bank statements etc. I provided everything they requested. Since then, I have entered the Kafka-esque nightmare of BDC\u2019s customer service process. I have been batted from one agent to another week in week out. I get stuck on calls for 2-3 hours at a time, frequently getting cut off. Every interaction is Groundhog Day and I have to start the conversation from scratch as if they keep no records whatsoever. They ask me to resend the same evidence every single week. They wrote to me a month ago apologising for their error and assuring me that my refund was being processed. They sent a second letter stating I would have my refund within 5-7 working days. But a month later still no refund and still being asked to provide the same evidence. I have trawled through LinkedIn for everyone with customer in their job title and include all of these individuals in my emails - including their CEO - in the hope that an actual competent human being will resolve it. Not a single one has replied. I\u2019ve never encountered anything quite like it. It\u2019s too much money to lose and Booking.com are saying they will refund it.

We couldn\u2019t open the freezer baskets (apart from the fact they were completely broken anyway), as the huge build up of ice was impossible to shift. Adam advised us that they don\u2019t always have time between guests to defrost but this hasn\u2019t been done since the fridge was put in by the looks of it!  We didn\u2019t use the kitchen cupboards as they were very dirty and a lot of greasy handles etc. The bathroom floor was disgusting as was the wall surrounding the shower. The sockets had a half inch of filth on them in the rooms. The windowsills have never been cleaned and the radiators were so filled with dust and hair that when the heating was on, it smelled like something was burning. There was no health and safety equipment in case of fire, no fire extinguisher or fire blankets. One of the blinds in the living room was broken. The sofa was dirty and extremely uncomfortable. The beds were clean and the towels were too but that is the only nice thing I can say about the flat. The mattress on the bed in the larger room had springs sticking up, making for a really uncomfy nights sleep. The flat itself is based right beside Lark Lane which is a fantastic area but even that couldn\u2019t compel us to stay another night in this flat. If we had paid very little for the week, I would have been less angry about the lack of upkeep but in this instance I am disheartened at the sheer neglect of the place. Adam advised he\u2019d given the cleaning company \u201c a rollicking\u201d, but didn\u2019t offer to get them back in to clean. He asked if we wanted him to come over but we were in town by then, eating out as we couldn\u2019t eat in!!! The outside light is out too so it was very difficult to get the key in the lock after dark.

The hotel clearly had anti social behaviour problems as we were advised not to park are car near the building as people often throw cigarette buts, bottles and condoms out of the window. We entered the room and to cut a long story short it was in such disrepair that we immediately decided we would look for accommodation else where. I phoned booking.com who said that was fine and they would sort it out with the manager of the hotel so that we get a full refund. But guess what two days after the hotel refused the refund and booking.com took their word at face value and didn't even bother to investigate. I have since been promised a refund on several occasions and still received absolutely nothing. They also block 90% of bad reviews (as they have with mine) to inflate the reviews on their website. Finally please also be advised that booking.com allow the hotels listing to \"Supply\" there star status and do not check this, therefor the \"4 star\" hotel we were meant to be staying in actually had none.

I booked a stay at a hostel in Zagreb, which was for a business trip, but I booked it as a private trip because I did not know at the time that my employer would later contact me and offer a refund if I was able to provide a VAT (\"R1\" in Croatia) invoice. So, the refund would come from my employer, not as a refund from Booking.com - they would still get to keep my funds and that is fine by me. I first asked at the hostel while I was staying there, where they raised an eyebrow, checked the system and told me that, since I had booked via Booking, I needed to ask Booking directly. I do so, and in the following months, this happens: 1) October 2021 - I request an invoice via a form on their website - I receive a mail that asks me to write to their partneroffer invoices e-mail, I do so. A few days later, I get an automated answer saying I should request an invoice via the link in my booking confirmation. The issue is, this would give me a normal invoice, not a VAT invoice. 2) Still October 2021 - I decide to call their customer service (after spending hours online trying to find the local contact number), a lady picks up and tells me the same thing, she was reading from an internal note and translating it from English simultaneously, told me she can help me request the invoice via the e-mail link. It seems they had closed my ticket without anyone informing me that the internal department had left an answer to my request, and I had to actively call. I thank the agent and try to do it myself, as she seemed very new and insecure, and the form was quite clear. I add my company data and the e-mail of the company finance department. 3) November 2021 - I send another question via form because I received no invoice in the span of almost a month. I ask if it had maybe been a mistake listing my company's email rather than mine, if the invoice may have gone to my company's spam and if what I am asking is even possible to do. I receive quite a rude two-line e-mail from an agent telling me that it can take a while but he can't tell me how long. He does not reply to my other questions. 4) Late December 2021 - After receiving no document or info for another month, I submit a complaint to their conflict resolution center. I receive an e-mail very quickly, asking me for the details of my order, which I submit right away and even go so far as saying that I understand if they cannot answer quickly due to the holiday season. I attach my booking and payment proof. 5) Late January 2022 - After not receiving an answer for yet another month, I reply again and submit my info once more, this time without attachments in case they have caused my e-mail to not show up right in their system or something like that. A week has passed and I got zero replies and now my patience has reached its maximum. I work a similar job and understand backlogs, but receiving no answer except automatic e-mails and one solitary two-line e-mail within the span of 5 months really makes a consumer think that nobody works there or that nobody cares about one's issue. I am fully aware that what I am asking for is a borderline favor, but this is why I have underlined every e-mail I sent with \"I understand if what I am asking for cannot be done, just please inform me so I can inform my finance department before the fiscal year is up\". I have never received a reply to this question in what will almost be half a year soon. One positive thing I will say about them is that the website makes finding hotels convenient, but I will think twice before recommending Booking.com or booking via them again, as the negatives outweigh the positives by far. The nonexistent transparency is what hurts customer trust the most and I hope they do something to change the way they do customer support.","review_rating":1,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":1137,"author":"Hannah Frostman","location":"unknown","date":"2022-01-29T22:10:18.000Z","headline":"Staff do not understand the boking.com system","review_body":"From a hosts point of view staff do not understand the system.

When I called booking.com the representative told me the reason why I hadn\u2019t gotten my refund was because my reservation was never cancelled\u2026. At this point we\u2019re in fall of 2020 . I knew again this was b.s. because I cancelled the same day and I spoke to them and provided this information already, so I AGAIN contact the holiday inn . I sent them their proof yet again, and they tell me they sent the refund i again ask them if it can be mailed. First they tell me they only deal with bank accounts they don\u2019t do paper checks. And when I reminded them it couldn\u2019t go to that account because it was closed they said they would contact the finance department give them the mailing address and see if I could get a paper check \u2026. Of course, that didn\u2019t happen ! I contact my bank and they FINALLY tell me that booking.com had tried to issue the refund but it had been rejected because the account was closed. (Keep in mind that at this time they had tried to issue the refund for a few months, but it wasn\u2019t at all the time they were TELLING ME THEY ALREADY ISSUED IT). I call booking.com they ask for proof that the refunds were being rejected I sent it and AGAIN told them that the bank account has been closed and I\u2019ve notified them via email and phone with my mailing address. Why keep sending a refund to an account that you KNOW no longer exist? Of course they just kept talking about their finance team and saying I needed to send them a copy of my last 6 statements , we\u2019re well into 2021 at this point I go into the bank in person yet again , sit down with BOTH of the branch managers that I have been working with and at this point they can\u2019t even go that far back. I tell booking.com they asked for proof that it was closed ? I\u2019m not understanding, what they aren\u2019t understanding\u2026. You already have the proof of it being rejected and everything else ! But nevertheless\u2026 they were only able to pull up the LAST STATEMENT which was the official charge off from booking.com. I sent it to them and they just keep saying they sent the refund and I need to call my bank now I\u2019m back at square one ! I\u2019ve called pnc customer service, gone to pnc in person and contacted the holiday inn and it\u2019s not even their fault ! Booking.com are con artists and have HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS. I just got off the phone with booking.com AGAIN and per usual they\u2019re gonna contact their finance team, and I shouldn\u2019t worry they assure me I\u2019m going to get my refund . I calmly said Sir it\u2019s 2022 , booking.com has caused me to lose my bank account, all types of debt collectors are calling me from pnc , I have kids , it\u2019s a pandemic and I\u2019ve been getting the run around from day one, at this point, you guys need to provide me with proof that you sent the refund WITH the account number showing , to see if it\u2019s the same as the one that was provided it\u2019s that simple. Y\u2019all have sent me through all types of hoops I gave all of the documents requested, give me my money or show me the PROOF that you sent the refund WITH the accounts to match.","review_rating":1,"num_like":3,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":1153,"author":"Mr Scott Carlucci","location":"unknown","date":"2022-01-27T16:02:30.000Z","headline":"As a supposed \"partner\" of booking.com\u2026","review_body":"As a supposed \"partner\" of booking.com I can honestly say that the business model they operate is unethical and I have good reason to class them as bullies and theives.Booking.com have wedged themselves between us as accommodation providers and our customers.

Understandably we were now been made to feel fairly stressed.I had to ring Booking.com again, this time I spoke to Amar who stated he had no information on my previous call, therefore i had to repeat my issue again, he also stated he had no information or contact details for \"Samantha\" whom I had spoken to 15minutes prior. All this time was increasing pressure to ensure we would get to the airport in time for our flight.Amer again stated he would try and contact the taxi company whilst I was on the phone - I waited 20 minutes on hold and got no answer. Due to call rates, each of these phone calls cost me a total of \u00a354.79 which had they provided an adequate service I would not have had to make.Eventually an hour after our prearranged time, we had received no communication from booking.com or the taxi company, feeling incredibly anxious that a journey on a Friday during rush hour to the airport can take longer than expected and a plane to catch we felt forced to pay another fee of $70 plus $20 tip for another taxi service. This again was additional money that we did not expect or want to have spent.The whole experience left me and my partner exceptionally distressed - not the ending to a holiday we had hoped for. Traveling especially during these times is already stressful enough with different rules and regulations changing constantly. So its incredibly unnerving when you receive such an unreliable and incomeptant service from Booking.com. It was the last thing we needed.My experience with Booking.com has negatively impacted my confidence within travel industry, and certainly will not be a using Booking.com for airport taxi service again in any future travels and i certainly intend to share my dreadful experience with others.Communication was awful and when we eventually got home we put a complaint in to customer service. All we were offered was 10% off our next booking - after this expereince I would never choose booking.com as a realiable company to use for airport transfers, quite frankly it is an insult of a good will gesture.","review_rating":1,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":1189,"author":"Verna Herrmann","location":"unknown","date":"2022-01-20T16:09:26.000Z","headline":"I WASNT  WELL HAD CANCER TREATMENT\u2026","review_body":"I WASNT  WELL HAD CANCER TREATMENT HAPPENING 21ST DECIDED TO SPOIL MYSELF AT PORT DOUGLAS AFTERVTREATMENT AT CAIRNS AN HOUR  LATER STILL TRYING TO BOOK 3 NIGHTS HAVE JUST GIVEN UP MAY AS WELL STAY HOME MUCH CHEAPER BETTER SERVICE AND PLE NTY OF WINE AND A BEAUTIFUL POOL AND SPA TO MYSELF EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED","review_rating":1,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":1190,"author":"Bob Parker","location":"unknown","date":"2022-01-20T14:50:22.000Z","headline":"I booked a hotel at what I thought was\u2026","review_body":"I booked a hotel at what I thought was the hotel site la Quinta.

Customer service weren\u2019t willing to help, and any response you get in text almost seems to be automated - not answering the questions that you have asked. I found the service poor both for a trip booking and also for a hotel room booking, it really felt likeBooking.com don\u2019t care about you at all once they have your money. Hotel booking - We arrived at a hotel to find dirty sheets, a door that wouldn\u2019t lock, white stains all over the bed spread and brown stains on the bathroom wall (this wasn\u2019t a common occurance in Sri Lanka). The man on reception also didn\u2019t speak any English and didn\u2019t seem to know that we were coming. As we arrived late we had to stay here for the night (we had a terrible nights sleep and literally slept in our clothes). We had booked 3 nights but were going to leave early morning. I contacted booking.com by telephone to ask if they could make sure that if we left and paid for 1 night that we wouldn\u2019t get charged for the other two nights (I think even paying for 1 night was unfounded but we just wanted to leave without fuss). The person I spoke at booking.com was no help at all and said I had to sort this out with the staff at the hotel (which was difficult due to the language barrier) we were also quite upset by this point as we were on our honeymoon and didn\u2019t want an uncomfortable situation. We managed to pay for one night and leave however. Since then I have received an email from booking.com asking if we stayed 3 nights, and when I said no it requested information on why, do they not make notes of conversations and complaints?! Really terrible service, so frustrating as once you have booked customer service is literally appalling and you are on your own.Trip Booking - we booked two safaris on two separate days (one morning and one evening) for a cost of 90 US a trip, there was no mention when we booked of any additional costs that would need to be paid. When we set of on the safari we reached the park gate and we\u2019re asked for an additional \u00a330 (approx) for a park entry fee. Not an insignificant sum after already spending 90 US, and we had not been made aware of this when booking. This caused confusion with our driver who didn\u2019t speak much English and gave everyone a bit of stress, we also saw other tourists who booked with booking.com having the same issue. We were not prepared for this cost and had no cash with us, so I had to use my card which I was luckily carrying but this also meant expensive foreign transaction fees. If we had know about this we would have only booked one safari, or both on the same day as we were now faced with this unexpected charge on our next safari too. I tried to get in touch with booking.com initially by chat but this is apparently not an option for trip bookings. So I sent an email and got a cryptic reply that didn\u2019t really answer my complaint and query, following this booking.com asked me to rate the response I received of which I rated it unsatisfactory and again detailed my experience and complaint. This was a waste of my time, as I was then sent an identical reply from a different agent. We are quite reasonable people and not usually one to take the time to complain but I have really found that for such a huge company booking.com seem to have zero morals and zero care for their customers. It\u2019s a shame because the app is pretty good and easy to use, but customer support to back this up it\u2019s useless.","review_rating":1,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":1200,"author":"mark","location":"unknown","date":"2022-01-19T03:18:17.000Z","headline":"no good no good","review_body":"no good no goodI booked an air fare and put it on CC. online. it said \" \"waiting for conformation, ck your email or text\"waited for 24 hrs. , no conformation!!called the , they said\" book again\" the price was up.no good customer service.","review_rating":1,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":1201,"author":"Slavo","location":"unknown","date":"2022-01-18T21:57:48.000Z","headline":"Just one, big, cheeky SCAM hiding behind nice logo and colourful pictures - part 2","review_body":"Just one, big, cheeky SCAM hiding behind nice logo and colourful pictures (which are often fake as well and photoshopped). About my case: I was their user for a while, I have 2 accounts (for me and my wife) and I am frequent traveller.I booked a room in US for a couple days. When I came to the place, it turned out to be so bad, that my wife cried and I had to leave it quickly and book again something else (I spent there maybe 1\/2 hour, I had a booking for nearly 2 weeks).In short, ugly, terrible place like 3m x 1,5m with bunk bed (advertised as \"double bed\"), dirty toilet shared with X guests, in different floor than then room and even far from the stairs, place completely ignoring covid 19 restrictions (which was a problem for me because I am from UK and I had to pass number of covid tests and be covid-free to be able to come back to UK), obviously no TV, no internet etc. just slums.Then I contacted the accommodation's manager and booking.com and asked for refund. The accommodation refused saying \"no refund\" (kind of their business strategy, first they provide fake ratings, pictures looking different than then place then they use booking.com - the biggest scammer in business, so e.g. on all other websites, the same accommodation has 1 star or 2 stars, while on booking.com they have proud 3 stars and 30 x more reviews than on competitors website probably because of that). (find out more reading about \"fake ratings\" under below links or on Trustpilot).Then I contacted booking.com (because I purchased the service on their website). In short, I have been emailing, chatting and calling them many times and all the time I heard \"it is accommodation\" or \"they are refusing\" etc. etc.I also asked to explain, why booking.com maintain this fake 3 stars rating for such place, I was told that \"the hotel or 3rd party provider provides its own rating\". Interesting.Finally, after few days they stopped replying to me (on all channels, mail, contact form, chat) and they disabled chat option on my account (I know because I have other account as well). When I called them, they hanged up and then, called me back and when I picked up, then they were pretending that something is wrong with the connection (like you would speak to the phone from 1 meter distance) and again hanged up.I imagine, that its not that the person who works hard in their customer service is guilty here, because I called some \"local CS\" from different city in US. I guess they simply have some \"procedures\" like probably they just tag some customers as \"don't talk to him\" or \"customer claiming refund\" or something and then those poor people working on CS have to follow that.I was surprised seeing how they actually operate. It is giant company, registered on NASDAQ, I receive business ads like \"invest in booking.com\" and they have methods like some Easter European mafias, they call you, then hang up, they disable chat or contact form, I guess a few more emails and they are gonna poison my dog or shoot to my windows from AK47 in the middle of the night. I lost a lot of money and will never open their and related app or website again (Kayak, Priceline, Agoda, OpenTable, and RentalCars).I plan to move ahead with my case and engage some legal actions here and I will also complain on this to relevant authorities and I will describe in my other comment where I sent my complains, why, what was the result of that and how to do that, so other people can also try not to be cheated.

Sorry.There is no other company on the whole entire Trustpilot with SO MANY complaints and so bad rating (1.3 in a scale 1.0 - 5.0 and with almost 30`000 reviews!), Almost 60% of rates are \"bad\" (the worst one) and first X comments from top to bottom are complaints one by one.They cheat their customers on EVERY FIELD and that gives them an advantage over their competitors (e.g. Expedia).There are thousands of reports for:- compromised credit cards and frauds (booking.com does not take any responsibility for anything and maintain fake ratings and fake accommodations with 0 control on them, so you might think that you do the right thing typing your credit card number in the form on their website, but in reality, it is being shared directly with your accommodations with all your data!So considering the way how they operate - your card might have just been printed somewhere in some fishy hostel in the middle of Amazon Jungle (e.g. like mine, I saw my credit card printed on paper in Amsterdam a couple years ago, on top of the stack of other prints, right in front of me).- fake accommodations and fake ratings (perhaps that is why they still have 1.3 \/ 5 but not 1.0 \/ 5)- problems with hotels\/hostels cheating people which booking.com still supports against their customers and despite many complaints- problems when an accommodation looks very different in place than on pictures or looks terrible or is unsafe and booking.com still offers it against their customers, despite complaints- problems with refunds\/cancellations, frauds from 3rd party services etc.- manipulations on prices, offers, offers availability, descriptions etc.- problems like e.g. hidden cameras in some accommodations- number of other problems (see comments on Trustpilot and some links below)Sooner or later, they will cheat you too. Probably a few times you will successfully find an accommodation there and then, one day... whenever you will have any problem, with anything, ... you will see how it really works.In short, they way how it works is: They are interested in only you to pay for something, room or car etc. Then they pass your credit cards and data to your accommodation or service provider and they take their commission (very high one, see links below, sometimes it turns out to be up to 40%). Now the job is done...Since then, if anything happen to you, its entirely your problem.What they give you (for up to 40% of what you pay) is a browser with hotels and cars.There is absolutely no responsibility on their side and you have no warranty for anything whenever you use their website.Also, they cheat as well customers, as well hotels and on every field as well, so complains come not only from customers, but actually from hotels too.For example they charge hotels aggressively (see links below) or e.g. they maintain fake ratings, e.g. in my case I paid similar money for one of the most famous, branded hotel with 3 stars and almost the same money for some fishy, ugly hostel with also 3 stars and in the same city and the same day! (because I had to change because when I came to the place, it turned out to be too ugly to stay there).So, imagine that you are the owner of this expensive hotel and you pay high taxes, licences, franchises, you provide number of services like room service, 24h reception, phones, TV, a lot of other things and you have to pay number of other fees and you have 3 stars on booking, the same as some \"fake hostel\" which doesn't have to pay anything and is actually unlicensed and unregistered but it has 3 stars as well and it has similar prices like you (the only difference is that it has photoshopped pictures on booking).Here some sources to see: - type on google \"is-booking-com-scam\"? (from happilyevertravels )- see other complaints on \"complaintsboard\"- type \"booking misleading sales tactics\" (from cnn)- type \"travel news hotels spain take legal actio against booking\" (from express)- see topics \"Beware booking reviews\" and \"Booking and credit card security\" (tripadvisor)I lost a lot of money and will never open their and related app or website again (Kayak, Priceline, Agoda, OpenTable, and RentalCars). I plan to move ahead with my case and engage some legal actions here and I will also complain on this to relevant authorities in US and UK, I will share results..._I will leave 2nd comment here as 2nd part of this one (because of chars limit) (@TripadvisorTeam I hope you can allow this exceptionally because I have more than 1 experience with booking so I will let myself to leave 2nd comment, Thank you and I am sorry).Thank you and good luck guys.","review_rating":1,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":1204,"author":"Chris","location":"unknown","date":"2022-01-18T18:36:40.000Z","headline":"Never Again","review_body":"HI, I will never use booking again.

By the time I receive the refund (if I ever actually do!) it will have been over a month since the issue started. I Wish I would\u2019ve come onto the review section before I went with Booking.com as overall 57% of reviews are diabolical 4% a poor 7% average 4% are good and a measly 27% are great. This completely sums up my terrible experience with this company. They are representing the OYO who have different branches around the country when they can\u2019t actually get a hold of them to initiate a refund. However they chose to keep being partners with them! And you can easily book a hotel room with one of their branches. Countless advisors and managers Have tried to contact this company who by the way I have contacted easily and had immediate responses from but booking.com cannot seem to negotiate or even hold a conversation with this company. At the start of this predicament I spoke to an advisor who told me it was company policy for their partner company to reply to them within 24 hours four or five more advisors after that told me the same thing however when I spoke to the manager for the first time he told me actually it was five working days! Not good enough train your staff correctly! I was told by an another advisor that my refund would be issued within 7 to 12 working days I called five days later just as a check up call to see where they\u2019re at and was disappointed to find out that they needed more confirmation from the OYO before they even process the refund which I had been told they already had. I then had to contact the OYO myself because booking.com were to incompetent to do so. I then had to send screenshots of my conversation with OYO to booking.com so they can verify it with their finance team as they apparently cannot get a response yet they aren\u2019t chasing anything to receive a response. I\u2019m now going to have to wait another two working days for them to review and decide whether that\u2019s good enough for them to then initiate the refund which will take 7 to 12 more working days.

Always liked the company, and never had any problems, although had never needed a refund before this.A hotel I couldn't stay at due to covid kindly offered me a refund, despite me not being entitled to one. Unfortunately, the money went back to Booking.com, and not straight to me. Booking.com never contacted me to say they had the money, so me and the hotel had to work this out between us. After contacting Booking.com, I was told the refund was on its way, and to wait 12 days. It didn't come through. I repeated this process again, getting the same \"answers\" (for want of a better term), but not the refund. I had to explain myself over and over again every time I rang up (including 5 separate times in one day). Several times they promised to call me back and did not do so. It was impossible to speak to a supervisor. Customer service staff are very friendly, but clearly have very little power to do anything, and so cannot really help in many cases. Supervisors are apparently always busy, and there is no possibility to contact them directly, or even to speak to the same person each time. I suspect they made mistakes with the refund processes, but I don't know, because they didn't communicate much with me, and when they did it was through repetitive automated processes. Eventually, after weeks of nagging and frustration, I got my refund - over 2 months late. Considering they were a company I have used for a long time, they really snatched defeat from the jaws of victory here.

I had to apply one star here in order to make a review but booking.com do not deserve even one star.  I am writing this review in the hope that others will see it and know to steer clear of booking.com so that they will not have to endure the trauma that we had at the hands of booking.com.We had a committed booking with a hotel in a ski resort on booking.com that we fully paid at the end of November 2021 (we paid \u20ac6k for 4 rooms on 30th of November and at that point once payment was made, the money was non-refundable) yet when we arrived, (exhausted after travelling since 4 a.m.) we were told that only 2 rooms were available.  We were then sent to another hotel an hours' drive away which created a whole series of inconveniences regarding hire of ski equipment\/ money paid that has not yet been refunded etc.  There was no adequate explanation given with both the hotel and booking.com blaming the other. It seems as though either the hotel or booking.com were gambling that we would not be able to travel due to Covid so saw fit to re-let our room.Having arrived at the hotel at 3.30 in the afternoon and watched other selected customers get keys to their rooms we were sent to a hotel in a location that we had not chosen (and did not want to be in) at 6 p.m. that evening.  The whole experience was not just traumatic and stressful but appalling from the point of view of customer service.  When we informed booking.com their response was that \"this is definitely not something we would like our guests to experience\" - a pallid, lack-lustre response which suggests that they have no appreciation of the stress and anxiety caused or simply don't care.  We have been relocated on booking.com reservations in the past but to properties \"across the road\" in cities like London - not an hours drive to another resort and not where the booking had been fully paid over one month in advance. In summary, Booking.com seriously breached their commitment to provide us with 4 rooms which merits more than a \"we apologise for the inconvenience and discrepancy\". We suffered the following:1. embarrassment while we were put to one side at the hotel reception and eventually told to go to another hotel. Why were we the ones selected to be turned away? Why were we dealt with in such an unsatisfactory way in full view of the public. I can only assume other \"successful\" guests thought our credit was refused2. we had to rearrange ski hire at short notice and higher expense - an additional cost of \u20ac6823. we had to cancel and re book COVID related travel tests at the new location.","review_rating":1,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":1257,"author":"Sergei Petrov","location":"unknown","date":"2022-01-10T13:41:50.000Z","headline":"5 problems","review_body":"5 problems - 0 solutions.","review_rating":1,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":1258,"author":"Mikkel Emil Dahlgaard","location":"unknown","date":"2022-01-10T08:28:59.000Z","headline":"worst. booking. experience. ever.","review_body":"After a long time (hours)  searching booking.com for a nice apartment or room to rent in Lisbon i finally spot the perfect apartment and it's cheap too.

Upon arriving in the country, on Dec 25, and making our way through the maze of the airport immigration and customs check points, with 7 ppl and a baby, we arrived at the Budget car rental kiosk only to be told that the rental that we had booked with them through booking.com had been sold to another customer since we were past the 1 hour buffer on our pickup time... They also said that they had no other cars available for us at this time. At this point we had the 7 of us plus a baby, with no car seat (car seat was part of the rental agreement) in a country where we had limited phone service options and resources and unable to get a large enough car for the week that we would be staying there...From when we landed to when we got to the budget kiosk it took 1.5 hours, due to the long holiday lines at immigration and customs. Evidently, it is their policy that if you are 1 hour late they have the right to rent your car to someone else and not refund your money. My problem with this is that apparently they use the arrival time of your flight as the pickup time, making it nearly impossible (especially during the holidays) to make it from the gate to the car rental kiosk in under an hour... my family was forced to find other travel accommodations at a far greater cost that wasn't even large enough to fit everyone so we were forced to drive around with family members and a baby that were improperly secured in the vehicle.Both budget and booking.com said that they stood by this ludicrous policy and that they would not be refunding us the $500 for the rental that we never received. We will not be using either of these services again, and hope that this information helps others in their decision making while looking for companies to aid them in their travel plans.","review_rating":1,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":1268,"author":"Vanessa","location":"unknown","date":"2022-01-09T00:38:09.000Z","headline":"They don't help with any problems","review_body":"They don't help with any problems, they dismiss your comments and allow host to scam you and mistreat you, they don't care about customers , they let a hotel that try to ask more that the reservation price to charge me $434 and I didn't even stay there a single day, they let host steal people money, it's so wrong they wouldn't even let me review the hotel after they charge me.","review_rating":1,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":1269,"author":"Rob","location":"unknown","date":"2022-01-08T22:56:36.000Z","headline":"Trust Trustpilot!

I have booked flights for both my son and husband separately via booking.com to Poland in the beginning of December.  However, we have found out the inbound flight coming back to UK, the check in luggage was always not done even I had already paid in my bookings.  My son's trip was a bit lucky as I managed to make a couple of calls and added his check-in luggage before he flew out to Poland.  But for my husband's trip it was really a disaster.  At the end his luggage was not added and he had to pay to the airline himself just a few hours before the flight take off.  Every time I called booking.com and they told me that the inbound flight check in luggage will be added when check-in was available.  However, it didn't make sense at all as my son and husband were flying with Ryanair and they could have checked in anytime if we paid for it and no need to wait 24 hours before the flight take off.  Because my husband's check-in luggage was not done so he could not check-in.  He waited just 24 hours before the flight and we had made at a few calls to booking.com to chase that.  At the end just before a few hours the flight take off, I was told that they were unable to add the check-in luggage and my husband had to purchase it himself.  Luckily my husband managed to do it online before check-in otherwise he could have paid  \u00a365 for his luggage in the airport.Then we needed to follow up for the refund, the money we had already paid for our check-in luggage to booking.com which the service had not been delivered, and the extra we had paid to buy the check-in luggage ourselves.I have tried to write a complaint at booking.com website and i received e-mails automatically saying I need to call the flight department.  But when I called the flight department they said they didn't know anything about the emails I received. My husband has  sent the invoice for the luggage purchase to the refund department but nothing had been heard for nearly a month.  And my complaint didn't go anywhere as it turns out that booking.com was using GoToGate for flight bookings, it is under the umbrella of etraveli.com.  What on earth I would know all about this?  They have never mentioned, so I had to file the complaint to etraveli and I can just file online which I have no idea what the booking reference was using between booking.com and etraveli.com, so I was unable to file a complaint.   I have to say it is totally a mind-field.    This is the most unsatisfied,   frustrated and stressful experience I have ever had with any travel agents.  The most frustrating things are1.  I was told we need to call to add the check-in luggage even we were abroad and we have already paid for the service up-front  I have told them that don't assume every can make call abroad and it may cost a lot to customers making call abroad should be just for emergency and nothing should be already paid and planned2.  there is no way to talk to anyone who can address my issue directly, they will just keep re-directing me to send an email or website which no one will get back to you3. They should have refunded the amount of money automatically with the service which had not been delivered and not sure why they needed a receipt for the refund4. I have spoken to around 10 of the customer services, each of them giving me different answers.  Some said the case has been escalated and will get back to me in 48 hours.  But nothing happened. and when I requested to talk to their supervisors, some of them just didn't reply at all and kept silence until I hanged up5. in booking.com there is no way to talk to anyone unlike expedia or opodo I can always find someone I can talk to and address my issues when needed6. Price wise, booking flight with booking.com is not even a lot cheaper than booking the flight with Ryanair directly if I book directly with Ryanair I will be sure that my luggage will be checked in as I planned for.Now, I won't book any flight with booking.com anymore as i will never be sure my check-in luggage has been done correctly as I have paid for.  I think I will be likely not using booking.com anymore due to the confidence I have totally lost from these experiences.I have asked one of the customer services about giving me a reason why I should choose booking.com next time if first price wise I am not really better off and second I don't receive the service I have already paid and on the top it creates a lot of hassle and stress which should not be happened.  And the customer service said that it is all up to me!!!  So now I know it's all up to me!!!","review_rating":1,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":1287,"author":"Elie","location":"unknown","date":"2022-01-06T09:41:58.000Z","headline":"Poor service and lies","review_body":"They're not protecting you, keeping your money even if you're not staying (in my case the room was full of bugs), promised to refund, but never saw the money back.

My issue for Booking.com is that my review of this property, along with a whole raft of others in the last 6 months, whilst uniformly highly critical and therefore important to people seeking to book accommodation, disappear from the Booking.com site for this property and can only be seen if Negative reviews are specifically requested.  This means that negative review are hidden, perhaps deliberately hidden, from users of the site.  This  fatally undermines the usefulness of Booking.com as potential customers do not see all the relevant information unless they seek it out, and it is hard to find.

I specifically wanted a room with a kitchenette so I could do my own catering as a solo traveller. On arrival, there was no kitchenette. I wrote to both the apartment agency which is \"Business Studio Apartments Wolska by Renters\" and Booking.com. I requested a change of room to what I paid for or a refund. All the replies were apologies and an offer of paying a substantial extra amount to get a room with a kitchenette. The room was sold under false pretences. Booking.com customer service now deny that their site ever showed that a kitchenette was offered with the twin room. They had 2 weeks to change my room. I wrote to them almost every day and it totally spoiled my trip. If i got a refund, I could have gone elsewhere but they didn't do that. Also, when booking, for some reason \"Renters.pl\" didn't accept a credit or debit card despite my bank saying that there was no reason to refuse my cards. They offered an option to do an international transaction. I sent the money in PLN Polish currency and before they would allow me to get the key, they wanted proof of payment. I sent a screenshot but that wasn't sufficient. They needed a pdf. I sent that and all was \"well\" until a few days later when they requested extra money and if it wasn't paid, they would cancel my booking. No coherent explanation was made as to why I had to pay extra money. I didn't pay because I paid what they requested in the beginning. I would urge anyone thinking of going to Poland to be wary of this crowd. If I paid by credit card, I could have got a refund and I think that's why they refused a card payment.

We had been traveling around Canary islands, mostly staying in privately rented apartments. But for the New Year 28 Dec - 3 Jan we booked the apart hotel Coral Compostela Beach Golf via booking.com. The chosen hotel moved us to another accommodation last minute because of the double booking (!) without our consent!As it happened on a short notice, all the properties in the area were fully booked.We refused the suggested option (the new place was further from the town center and the beach) and tried to seek help from booking.com. However we spent almost 3 hours communicating with them and waiting in the parking lot. No help whatsoever!The first agent we talked to for 30 mins made us wait for the property response on his request. Of course the property didn't reply, and he didn't call us back either. So I had to call again myself. After that I've spent over 45-50 mins on the phone. The line got disconnected multiple times (just went silent).  But Booking.com people don't call back themselves!!! Had to call back as we were desperate.The agent was super slow, finally suggested a place far from where we planned to stay because they were trying to match the original price I paid booking in advance. Ridiculous to expect the last minute booking for the New Year in the popular area to be the same as booked in advance.After yet another disconnect I just gave up. I feel rather helpless as they don't provide any help in the cases like ours whatsoever.At the end we went with whatever was offered by the hotel management as we were incredibly tired after a day of traveling. We spent 1.5 hours purely on the phone, had to call them back a few times and had nothing resolved!!The room in the substitute hotel is bad, on the first floor, people passing by all the time.I used another website for apartments renting for the rest of beginning of our holiday.

There\u2019s a wide choice to suit all budgets. But I have recently had cause to question its ability to communicate effectively with its local partners on behalf of the customer \u2013 in my case this relates to a taxi service I booked on its platform to take me from my hotel in Paris to the Gare du Nord for my return journey on Eurostar. To summarise: I booked the taxi when I made my hotel booking as my train would be leaving early in the morning of 23 December. Two days before my scheduled departure, I realised I needed to leave an hour earlier than originally scheduled. I requested a change through the My Booking app. I then received a text direct from the local cab service confirming my booking but giving the original, not the amended, pickup time. Concerned there\u2019d been a misunderstanding, I contacted the Booking.com Customer Service through the app and got an email confirmation from a customer service representative that the taxi would arrive at the earlier time I\u2019d requested. But\u2026I got a second text from the taxi service quoting the original and now wrong time.   I emailed the customer services representative again, pointing this out, but got some reassurance from her reply confirming the amended time for the pickup.  On the morning I was due to leave I received an automated email direct from Booking.com stating the driver would be meeting me at the amended time. But\u2026no one turned up. I was unable to get through to anyone at the taxi firm and all a Booking.com customer services representative could do when I emailed was to ask if I\u2019d heard from the driver. After waiting for 25 minutes outside the hotel in the cold I made my way to the Gare du Nord by the metro and thankfully wasn\u2019t too late for my train which had been a worry given the added checks which have to be carried out due to the pandemic. I later received texts from the taxi service that a taxi driver was on his way and then a voicemail that he\u2019d waited for me and was now cancelling the trip \u2013 this was around the original pickup time. It\u2019s impossible for me to guess what Booking.com\u2019s back-office processes are like - but everything points to it being unable to ensure its local partner had the updated details. At 13:34 on my return home, I emailed Booking.com, giving a detailed timeline of events. I notified the firm I was complaining about the lack of service I received and requested a refund of the taxi fare (\u00a326.88). Not having a response, I chased this at 21:43, asking for someone to take ownership of this issue. A reply, which failed to acknowledge my complaint was received at 22:56 stating: \u201cSorry for what happen. (sic) I will assure you this won't be happen again. If there is anything else I can assist you with please let me know. I hope you have a pleasant journey.\u201d It is unclear if this emanated from an algorithm designed to identify certain key words and improvise a template response \u2013 or from a real person with limited understanding and interest in what went wrong. I have not heard anything further.  I assume Booking.com\u2019s Taxi department has shrugged off this incident. It is clearly not worth my while pursuing, given the small sum that effectively has gone down the drain (though the principle of having paid for a service not received remains).I shudder to think what would have happened if someone with a lot of luggage, or a young family, had been involved.","review_rating":1,"num_like":3,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":1355,"author":"Agathe De Vreese","location":"unknown","date":"2021-12-26T12:25:18.000Z","headline":"No cancellation possible even with\u2026","review_body":"No cancellation possible even with Covid restrictions from French government.Taking money out of my account while I was supposed to pay at the hotel.Customer service always blaming on the hotel refusing to cancel when not true.Terrible customer service, offering no service.

When we arrived, and this was during a massive heat wave with the temperatures reaching 40s, and with a tired animal in the car, the owner took us to a horrible room in a private part of the house, very shabby, no a\/c, toilet outside, most amenities we paid for - missing. She refused to give us a fan. The \u2018 terrace\u2019 was not usable, like a glass box from hell where the temperature reached catastrophic levels and again everything was nasty and shabby. Shower was literally in the room. The worst accommodation I had ever stayed in, ever. We asked for a reduced rate as the room we got was much worse than what we paid for, and we had no way of even suspecting this would happen as the room we got wasn\u2019t mentioned on the website.

Well, we tried but it being a weekend in France, no one was available.Anyway, in their success, they have completely left customer service behind. What happened to us was unfair and unacceptable.

Flying from London to South Africa to visit family we hadn\u2019t t seen in years. We unfortunately had to postpone our trip, due to South Africa going back onto the red list. We were then told that booking.com had given us \u201copen tickets\u201d to use at a later stage. When we heard the announcement on the 14th of December that South Africa was taken off the red list, we immediately went onto VA website to see dates and then book our tickets. When we phoned, and spoke to their call centre goto gate their agents were so unhelpful, unaccommodating and unprofessional to say the least! When we tried to rebook dates for the 15th of December returning the 6th of January, they wanted to charge us almost \u00a32700 more than what Virgin Atlantic wanted to charge us for the exact same flights! How insane is that? It is unacceptable. I\u2019m not sure if they get commission on sales they make, but that was never ever made clear! After that, we then decided not to fly in December, because they wanted to charge us \u00a34400 where on the VA site tickets were \u00a32900 for the exact same dates and information, meaning we would\u2019ve only had to pay in about \u00a3800. We then tried to book flights for the 1st of April until the 28th of April. And again they wanted to charge us an additional \u00a3700. It is not worth paying the difference in fees, as they aren\u2019t qualified travel agents. We have received no support from them!

I booked a hotel on the booking.com website. The hotel ia falsely adverting and booking.com do not care in the slightest. This hotel is at best a 2 star resort and is therefore misrepresenting on various platforms and should be taken down. It advertises itself as a 4 or 5 star property as they purport. I booked an apartment for 4 weeks on the 8th September 2021. I was given a hotel room not an apartment. That was the least of my worries, though.When I walked in to the hotel I was met with a vile acrid smell. The hotel is situated off a busy main road down a residential street. The outside is run down and tatty. It\u2019s 1980\u2019s style. I was taken to a room with intermittent hot water with old, stale and stained furnishings, yellowy walls from the tobacco that\u2019s been smoked in the room with a rock hard bed. It\u2019s disgusting. When I asked to see the gym I was taken to a room with an exercise bike. They advertise a gym. When I was shown the beach I was taken to a quarry. It\u2019s the most revolting hotel I\u2019ve ever stayed in. I was kept up the entire night with loud and violent banging emanating from the lift shaft. I kept the hotel informed via email to keep a record of the distress I was caused and informed that I would be making numerous complaints in the morning. I was met the next morning by a member of staff that tried her best but was not a proficient English speaker and could not grasp my complaint. Unfortunately I do not speak Thai. I was told that as I was checking out 27 nights early booking.com would deal with the refund for the unused nights. I didn\u2019t stay for 27 nights and then complain and demand a refund. I didn\u2019t use the nights and the hotel can re-sell the room. Instead the hotel has stolen my money. Booking.com have assisted the hotel with the robbery by allowing the hotel to falsely advertise and have told me that the hotel deals with the refund. As I said, the hotel have refused to refund and said it\u2019s Booking.com. Booking.com refuse to take any responsibility despite taking my money and tell me to speak to the hotel. Yes, really. I am still waiting for a refund after 3 months and will now have to take legal action.

The hotel we picked had a high price tag for the area but the pictures looked fairly good and for a last minute event we went ahead and booked. When we arrived around 11:30 pm and checked in we became instantly suspicious of the property as it looked different than the pictures represented on the site. When we got to the room our suspicion was verified by the absolutely disgusting room both in furnishings and cleanliness so as soon as the office opened back up we canceled the rest of our reservation and found a new hotel. The front desk confirmed they had refunded the money back to Booking.com and it could take up to 30 days to get the money back to my account.This was in October it is now December and Booking.com is barely doing anything to get us our money in the ballpark $600.00  numerous calls have gone with no reply other than they don\u2019t know why our funds haven\u2019t been put back in the account, The hotel will not speak with us because Booking.com is who booked the room not us (I\u2019m sure that\u2019s not true but Booking.com is responsible since they were who we paid). Thanks to Booking.com dragging out the reply process I can\u2019t just contest the charge with my financial institution and to top it all off after we made Booking.com aware of the problems with the hotel, the pictures and other provided information on their site being criminally inaccurate they took down the listing then put it back up a few days later with no real change except a few new reviews.","review_rating":1,"num_like":1,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":1458,"author":"Ivan Bar","location":"unknown","date":"2021-12-09T18:44:52.000Z","headline":"booking now is a scam don't fall","review_body":"booked a hotel for January,  went on booking.com ,my booking was cancelled without a reason and the reservation was conveniently nonrefundable,  lost 150 pounds and there is nothing they can do! was a client but never again","review_rating":1,"num_like":1,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":1459,"author":"Jess","location":"unknown","date":"2021-12-09T13:49:50.000Z","headline":"Removed a review of scam artist and refused to provide a refund for unsafe accommodation!","review_body":"Removed a review of scam artist and refused to provide a refund for unsafe accommodation!I booked a stay at the Slateford House Luxury Apartment in Edinburgh back in October. The place cost \u00a3992.32 a week which I was only willing to tolerate because, a) that weekend in particular was quite busy and, b) the photos were shot at an angle that made the apartment look habitable. When I got there, the whole apartment (most notably, the kitchen) smelled like a toilet, there was basically no insulation and the bedroom looked rundown and diseased! I genuinely believe that the flat could have a pest problem. Regardless, it looked very easy to break into and not safe for a woman traveling alone.As I had issues with phone battery and later issues with my network reception, I prioritised finding a last minute replacement and messaged both booking.com and the property owner once a more suitable accommodation was found about an hour or so after check-in. I received no response from the property owner and booking.com's customer support team assured me that they would handle this.I tried emailing the property owner the next day and still no response from him.The day after that I was able to get a signal strong enough to make phone calls. When I spoke to the owner, he insisted that he hadn't received any of my messages (both in the app or via email) and that booking.com had not contacted him. He then directed me to speak to booking.com about getting the refund.When I called booking.com, they said that they had tried to get in touch with the property owner but that he wasn't responding to their emails or phone calls. The person I spoke to seemed to understand that this was suspicious and said that this would be escalated to another team. It was maybe a week later (after a several phone calls back and forth) that it became apparent that the matter hadn't been escalated on their end at all.Eventually I received an email from a support agent saying that they would only issue a refund for the first night even though I hadn't spent a single night in the property. I received this email on the day of a flight that I had booked so I quickly wrote an honest review of the \"Luxury\" apartment and contacted the property owner via WhatsApp shortly afterwards. The property owner then told me that because I'd written the review, he would not issue a refund at all. A little later that day, I called Booking.com again to address the email that I received and the property owner's temper tantrum. The customer support agent insisted that no decision had been made about my case and didn't seem to know where the earlier email could have come from. They also agreed that the property owner's behaviour was clearly unacceptable and assured me that this would be taken into account when a final decision was reached.I waited for them to review the case and kept asking for an update. They assured me that a conclusion would be reached within 30 days of when the case was actually escalated.It has now been 30 days and not only has a decision not been reached but today I found that booking.com deleted my review of the property. The property still appears on their website and it is still possible to book a stay at the \"Slateford House Luxury Apartment\" but the review I wrote back in November (and I suspect at least one of the other negative reviews) was removed without notice. When I contacted the customer support team again, they denied that the review had ever been posted (even though there was written evidence to the contrary). From what I can tell, they seem to be actively protecting a rogue landlord who falsely advertised a property that was likely to be unsafe (if not just unhygienic). They also appear to be keeping the money to do who knows what with.I don't think I will be waiting much longer for a response from them at this rate. An ongoing visa dispute has been raised and I will be reporting the matter to the Financial Ombudsman in due course. As this seems to be a clear case of fraud (and not even the first that I've run into on booking.com this year, unfortunately), I will be discussing next steps with my lawyer and will likely involve the police as well.My advice to others: DO NOT under any circumstances use this company! They will waste your time and protect partners who will steal your money. They will mislead you about who has your money at various points in the process and make contradictory statements in order to buy time. Then to top it off, they'll delete all evidence of the fact on their end, allowing their partners to scam others later on.

But I will NEVER use them for booking flights ever again. I booked two sets of flights for the UK. When the UK changed their CoVID rules\/regulations I called booking.com to ask about my options for cancellation\/flight changes. I was told I would receive an email with my options. I was reassured that no changes would be made until I received emails indicating my options, after which I would have to call back to initiate the change. (Why couldn\u2019t I just know my options\/costs associated when I called in the first place?)Several days later, the day before my departing flight I received two emails, one for my second set of flights stating that I could move my flights but would need to contact booking.com to confirm, and another email for my first set of flights stating that my departing flight was non-refundable\/non-changeable but that a voucher was submitted in my behalf for my return flight. I immediately contacted booking,com and was met with resistance and told there was nothing they could do until they listened to a recording of my prior conversation to confirm that I hadn't asked for the voucher. Once confirmed, they could reverse the voucher request if my flight was still confirmed and it hadn\u2019t been processed. I was very upset. Because at this point, I am getting ready to leave the next day and now wondering if I have a flight back! Mid conversation the customer service rep hung up on me. (I was definitely airing my frustration). So I sent booking.com an email and also tried to reply to the email that was sent, letting me know a voucher request had been submitted. I didn\u2019t hear anything. Nothing good. Nothing bad. So I set off on my departure flight and all was good. But now, here I am off in the UK getting ready to check-in to my flight home, and there is no flight. I call booking.com and they Confirm a voucher has been issued but can\u2019t give me any information on how to use it. I ask to speak to a supervisor. I am told I should call the airline and see if they can reverse the voucher request and get me back on the same flight. If they can\u2019t, ask them how to use my voucher. I\u2019m just livid. Booking.com should have done this in the first place! So I call the airline and they say that booking.com has my voucher information and there is no record of my flight any longer and that the only way the airline can help me is to help me book a new flight, but not with my e voucher because it has to be issued by booking.com. So yet again. I call booking.com. This was my favorite rep who seemed to understand my frustrations of feeling stranded and yet, I am told I have to wait to be contacted by a supervisor which could be up to 24 hours. BUT MY FLIGHT LEAVES IN 24 HOURS!!! I\u2019ve now found myself rebooking the same exact flight through the airline for 2x the original cost, with a wasted unknown e voucher floating somewhere in space, with still zero news from booking.com and how they will remedy this situation. So so disappointed. Never ever ever would I recommend this platform for flight bookings. The headache and money lost is not worth the idea of a slightly cheaper flight. Also. For my second set of flights\u2026 understand that a \u201cflexible booking\u201d option does not mean the same as flexible booking directly with the airline. It\u2019s really just an added cost to make you feel like you have more control when in reality, it allows one flight adjustment (you have to know exactly what flight, day and time you want to move it to), and then at that point, you now have a flight with no flexibility. So. It\u2019s not the same as booking directly with the airline. Consider yourself warned.

They're getting 1 star becuse Trustpilot literally won't let me give 0.I would say this is closer to a clown academy than a competent business, if that wasn't so unfair on clown academies. I'll be telling anyone who'll listen to avoid these all cost in future, and I'll be contacting the ombudsman, \u00a3500 may be peanuts to a company this size but i'll maybe get some satisfaction knowing their incompetence has cost them more than it has me.","review_rating":1,"num_like":1,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":1477,"author":"Dave K","location":"unknown","date":"2021-12-07T11:28:16.000Z","headline":"One star, only because there isn't a zero star rating....","review_body":"One star, and only because zero isn't available.

After my last experience at the Ben Sheann hotel in Strathyre, I can say that I will never use Booking again, and would actively encourage people to steer clear. I had an appalling evening at a very poor hotel, a \"Preferred Partner\" of Booking whose high ratings and site description seem dishonest at best. In fact, my negative review of this hotel was hidden by Booking, which doesn't seem like a coincidence to me. I requested a refund of one night, as my last night was unacceptable in terms of guest safety (there was a powercut, yet the hotel owner made no accommodation for this: no torch or candles, no extra blankets to beat the cold, no breakfast possible of course due to lack of power in the morning, but the breakfast was included in the price). It seems noncontroversial to request a refund for a night where you are literally not getting what you paid for in any way. You can't use any of the things that cost the hotel owner money! No electricity usage, no heat, nothing. However, the hotel owner \"disagreed\" with my reasons for wanting a refund, and refused. Booking supported the hotel owner, and offered me a voucher worth one-third of the night's stay as compensation. They said they would not do anything further, though I pointed out that the conditions my husband I were left in (the only people in the hotel that night!) were unsafe and unacceptable.I find the whole experience disgraceful. How can you have a Preferred Partner that behaves in this way? This is not a hotel: it's a glorified bothy. No accommodations taken for guest safety in case of emergency is unacceptable. There wasn't even any way of contacting the owner or a staff member. Booking did not acknowledge any of this, and instead said that their hands were tied due to the owner's refusal to refund the single night. As far as I'm concerned, they seem to collude with poor properties to dupe customers. I would not trust any of the ratings they have on their listed properties, since they will hide reviews and not even explain why. You are much better off booking straight with a hotel that has some internet presence and an established reputation.

We paid for it in full months before and had corespondents back and forth. At no point did they mention that they had \u201cdouble booked\u201d us,  in fact they only told us on the day as we was travelling on the train . They said there\u2019s nothing they can do and we have to find somewhere else even though we had paid for it in full . We spend most of the travel panicking and trying to fine somewhere to stay as we was not fromLondon. Absolutely disgusting.Second time something similar, I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt and hoped it was a one off . But no they still managed to  do us over .Again booked an apartment months in advance fully paid , emails back and forth about who is staying in the apartment etc I explained I will be arriving later that evening but one party member will check us in . At no point did they mention that the card has to be present they emailed me the night before even though I explained another member will check in . They refused us to check in demanding that we cancel the current booking and rebook with the current card holder present . This was November and it was freezing again we had no choice but to pay for it again . On both occasions it was a battle to get a refund . Only after many phone calls and emails that I had to chase up did we get one. I would never use them again .

Booked an apartment for the weekend on here and it was a disaster - the apartment gave me the wrong details and so we ended up stranded outside for hours and having to pay for taxis to go and get the keys from a different location - total wild goose hunt which no one informed of us beforehand despite me calling them a week in advance. We ended up actually missing my 30th dinner we\u2019d booked (the entire point of the weekend away!). Also had to drop the keys back off for check out - again in a weird location far away from the apartment. Booking.com is only suitable if your willing to check your phone and emails constantly on the day and if you don\u2019t mind keys not even being at the property when you arrive. I\u2019ve also not received my \u00a3300 deposit back from the apartment and Booking.com said there is nothing they can do as the apartment do not agree to give any compensation - not sure if I will get the deposit back - it\u2019s not looking promising.Despite leaving the apartment nearly spotless and as we found it - I\u2019m now out of pocket due to spending money on 3 separate taxis just to pick up and drop off these keys - a hotel check in shouldn\u2019t be that complicated or time consuming.

The plan was that after dinner and drinks, she would go clubbing with friends and we would see a show.She was due to travel down to us in London from Bournemouth first thing on Saturday when we received a call from a friend to say that she'd become unwell he'd called an ambulance. I called the hotel straight after he'd rang (approximately 9am) to speak with them directly but reception explained I'd need to email their duty manager. In emailing I noted that the hotel was fully booked and felt that they may hopefully have enough time to resell the bookings - check-in wasn't until 3pm. They replied to say that they have a strict policy regarding refunds but that I would be allowed to rebook as long as I made contact within a week.By this time we were at the hospital and learned that our daughter was seriously ill. We stayed by her bedside for almost 24hrs before checking in to a local hotel exhausted to get some sleep. I managed to reply to Z Trafalgar updating them on how grave the situation was, how much stress we were under and that I would submit hospital records to substantiate what I had informed them of already requesting that I be refunded under theses extenuating circumstances.The hotel replied that I had until March '22 to make a booking or could gift the rooms to friends or family.Our daughter is currently a long-term patient in a hospital over 100 miles from where we live we will be travelling this distance regularly to see her. We really don't need the extra stress of re-organising our booking, never mind gifting the rooms. We feel that Z Hotel Trafalgar are displaying an utter lack of compassion in not refunding us.

I called them back and they said no refunds, I said \"listen to your recorded conversation with me and refund my money-it's your mistake, not mine.\" They finally agreed to do that and then told me \"Yes, you said Massachusetts over 4 or 5 times-we will refund you.\" Then had them book a hotel nearby us, we go to it and...we have no reservation there! I asked for a refund and another hotel with Booking.com in nearby Chicopee at a Residence Inn...and we get there...NO RESERVATION there either.! So now I hate Booking.com for their complete scammy incompetence, lies, and theft of my money. So-I got charged for the Great Britain hotel they fraudulently redirected me to, the one without the reservation Booking.com said I had in Springfield, Mass, and when we showed up at the Chicopee hotel Booking.com reserved-we were told they had no rooms available! It's 1am the next day by now and I was ready to have a meltdown-but the nice manager took pity on us weary travelers and gave us a room that was out of commission for weeks and was unavailable on all their sites and inside the hotel to people (while they tried to rid it of a former long-stay smoker stink). My husband stopped smoking 26 years ago, but smoke triggers his urge still. He was willing to stay there just to get some rest-so we could drive straight home the next day. (Booking.com ruined our trip enough that we cut it short). I notified them that they said they would refund the bill for the 2nd hotel, but Booking.com screwed that up, too. We got charged for that hotel and when I called the hotel to send me proof that we never stayed there-Kurt, from that same Hilton Hotel front desk (in Springfield, Mass) said they had no record before, during or after the date I was charged for. He said we didn't stay there. This is not only a bad company with bad policies, misadvertisement & misdirection to cheat you, but they are also incapable of accepting accountability (the cowardly, cheap, smarmy, rip-off artists). If you got cheated by them-file a complaint with your BBB, your Attorney General, tell ALL your friends & acquaintances to avoid Booking.com and try another site-or better yet, book it directly with actual the hotel. I expect Booking.com to refuse to do right by me, but I will follow up here with an updated review when they -uck me over again. You will then see exactly how bad they truly are! I will hopefully save you time & money, AND stop you from being scammed.","review_rating":1,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":1613,"author":"Marie","location":"unknown","date":"2021-11-18T19:17:13.000Z","headline":"Do not book a taxi through booking.com","review_body":"Do not book a taxi through booking.com.

Well, not stressfull at all, conserdering this was 5 minutes before my boarding, where I would strand in Dubai at midnight!!!!!! Quickly called booking.com, they promised to get back to me by e-mail, THEY NEVER DID. I also called hotel to see if I could book directly through them, but they told me that they were fully booked (but funny enough there was plenty of rooms on both booking.com and their website) I am very unsatisfied with \"Revier Dubai\" and also Booking.com.

I had to find an all night car park, so we could drive back after the concert, and NO chance of drinking beer at the gig :( and the car park cost another \u00a313.50. They could have let me know a week or even a day before, so I could have found a hotel instead, but they did not tell me until I drove 80 miles and I was parked outside the place.

However my latest experience has let me see another side to Booking.com and thought I would take a moment to share my experience.I used Booking.com to book a hotel for a weeks holiday in Portugal. It was made clear of the type of booking I made that there was a free cancellation policy. Due to what we considered a better option that came up with AirBnB we decided to cancel. Which we did and were sent an email that confirmed the booking was cancelled successfully and that no further action needed to be taken. So we thought that was sorted.It turned out that Booking.com had not cancelled the booking and we were charged \u20ac144 no show charge.When questioned what had happened, we were informed by booking.com that 'The Hotel' had made the charge and was out of their hands. When I asked for more clarification and disputed that Booking.com had made a mistake here I received no further communication. I have made multiple attempts to contact Booking.com customer service but with no response. I find this shocking and would strongly advise people not to book with Booking.com. You are far better off to deal directly with Hotels themselves, at least they will generally deal with disputes.

My review raised entirely demonstrable concerns both about the appalling quality of the hotel as well as about the booking.com decision to grade it as 'good' when other organisations graded it much worse and provided full details from customers about even worse experiences than mine, including theft of money and property by cleaning staff! The wiliness slipped over into frank dishonesty when I was sent a no-doubt automated decision my submitted, very critical review, was now live and I was invited to view it. Of course, the hyper-link took to me to a 'sales pitch' for this same hotel which, interestingly only featured ridiculously and unconvincingly positive reviews but none which were critical. When I eventually found mine buried deeply in the hotel reviews they published (you might have expected them to feature it first as the most recent .... mmm, I wonder why?!) my grading rating of 1 star was noted but all the details were 'hidden' because it 'failed to meet their standards' ... standards about what, I wonder?! Clearly this is a company which goes out of its ways to project all its compliant accommodation providers positively and only publishes reviews which enhance that projection. Clearly honesty, transparency and accuracy take a very back seat to shamelessly collusive commercial interests. Shame on them. I will certainly never believe a word about any reviews they publish now and, where possible, I will avoid ever making a booking with them for their flagrant dishonesty and lack of concern for customers.","review_rating":1,"num_like":1,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":1655,"author":"Pamela Vandervoort","location":"unknown","date":"2021-11-14T21:29:00.000Z","headline":"Do not use booking.com","review_body":"Do not use booking.com.

Have just gone onto their site and feedback has been left on my behalf by someone else stating that my stay was 'excelent'. This is quite disgusting and fraudulent.

I made my complaint and requested compensation in the form of a refund via booking.com as during my stay staff were rude and unhelpful  so I had no faith they would review and assess my claim fairly. Booking.com have been useless - sending correspondence to the hotel that did not include all the concerns I raised. I had also attached pictures that were not shared.

Hotel Largo BeachPromenade Street8240Slanchev Bryag,Sunny Beach,BulgariaTel: +359 89 900 0760At NO point in our communication did anyone tell us that the hotel season ended on 26th September and that the services\/facilities would be closed.Instead, I was asked to pay for the shuttle bus in advance and the card details were provided directly via my WhatsApp account.First of all, my 72 years-old mother arrived at a building with about 100 rooms on three floors, all completely empty, with the exception of her own room. There was NO kitchen, NO canteen, NO reception desk, NO security and there were NO other guests \u2013 in the whole building. My mother\u2019s room was on the third floor and food was delivered to her on a tray by a hotel cleaner. There was no option of going somewhere to choose what she wanted to eat, it was simply a case of the only thing that was available was delivered to her. My mother was so frightened to stay in that hotel that she hardly slept. When she spoke to some people by the seaside, she was told that the holiday season had ended on 26th September and people were surprised that nobody had told her this, and that she had been offered a hotel stay with full service included.In the morning she was offered a sandwich without any drinks, and in the evening, it was BBQ chicken but without any seasoning or vegetables or side dishes. As I mentioned, it was delivered to her room by the cleaner and she was not asked whether she liked it, she was just given the food.Please note that I had ordered half-board and had been asked to pay for it.My mother was transferred to another hotel on 30th September as I stated above. Complex Antantic - Plamen Todorov - Bulgaria, Ravda, Apostol Voivoda 12 Now I understand the reason why, as you probably can understand, a 72 years old lady in a foreign country staying at an empty 100-bedroom hotel - all by herself. I would be not be able to sleep at all. That is exactly how my mother told me she felt while she was staying at the Hotel Largo Beach.She was transferred to a facility owned by a close friend of the hotel owner, far from the beach, and was apparently moved there because the parents of the owner were able to feed my mother with the food, they were cooking for themselves.Again, no choice of food was given in this instance but at least it was better cooked as it was prepared by the owner\u2019s parents.As my mother was not shown where the beach was from the day she moved to this property (30th September) until 3rd October she mainly stayed indoors and occupied her time by sweeping the territory to keep it clean and to my surprise nobody stopped her from doing this.  I was paying for her to have a holiday, not to clean somebody else\u2019s property!The owner even offered my mother to come back next year for a whole season and sweep his property for 50 leva a week!Only on 3rd October was my mother shown the way to the beach, and finally on the 5th October she safely flew back home.I am astonished by the whole fiasco, I thought I knew what to expect from a half-board beach holiday, having experienced several such holidays in the past. Please note both names - Complex Atlantic and Hotel Largo Beach  - and i am still fighting for my refund with the booking.com who are totally ignoring me and my problem with this bookingNever again will book any trips to Bulgaria.","review_rating":1,"num_like":1,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":1696,"author":"Daniel Valko","location":"unknown","date":"2021-11-08T14:54:37.000Z","headline":"Shocking!

It wasn't.To cut a long story short, despite wasting around an hour a day each day of our holiday, using what little internet access we had we didn't get the refund until  21st Oct, four full days into a seven day holiday... fours days in which our daily budget was \u20ac20.00 rather than the \u20ac50.00 it would have been if we'd not been double charged... four days in which we had to resort to eating sandwiches in supermarkets rather than meals in restaurants... four days in which we had to drink water rather than beer \/ cocktails... four days in which we enviously watched others going on day trips or doing activities rather than going on day trips or doing activities ourselves... four days in which our expensive holiday was 'ruined'. Of course in reality we didn't 'have to' do anything of these things but if we'd spent money as we wanted to we'd have run out half way through the holiday and ended up in a foreign country surviving on hotel breakfast alone.In complaining after the event we have been told that there is nothing that booking.com can do other than offer an apology as we were 'not obligated' to make the proactive payment and booking.com hadn't done anything wrong... it seems that as we were not obligated to make that payment booking.com were not obligated to resolve the issue in a timely manner, rather it was perfectly acceptable for them to refund us nine days after we first raised the issue.A very disappointing and costly experience (in terms of our holiday enjoyment) with nothing other than a 'sorry' by way of response from Booking.com.","review_rating":1,"num_like":2,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":1706,"author":"Renee Hamilton","location":"unknown","date":"2021-11-07T16:21:56.000Z","headline":"This company is a joke","review_body":"This company is a joke.

I sent the following letter to Booking.com:\"We chose this place because it was about the cheapest option in an expensive area. The guy that checked us in, and apparently runs the place, was short on curtesy but we got it done. When I then asked about the breakfast he said \u201cNo breakfast, no coffee!\u201d along with a sarcastic comment about hadn\u2019t I heard of covid? When I replied that a complementary continental breakfast was mentioned on the web site, he started screaming \u201cShow me. Show me or you don\u2019t stay!\u201d and then  \u201cYou\u2019re calling me a liar!\u201d I was shocked. At this point, I decided we did NOT want to stay there whether there was coffee or not. I explained that I had never called him a liar but he was still very upset. He agreed to refund my non-refundable payment and yelled \u201cand you never stay here again!\u201d I laid down the keys, and walked out, telling him I\u2019d look for a receipt online.He followed me outside, got in my face, and said \u201cJust touch me\u201d. I didn\u2019t understand at first. He got closer and said \u201cJust touch me\" twice more. I realized then that he was looking for an excuse to punch me! I\u2019m 70 years old, he was half my age, and I\u2019ve never settled disagreements with my fists. I backed away, got in the car with my terrified wife, who saw the last psycho part, and drove away. By the way, checking later, the GG Tibet Inn's own web site DOES advertize Complimentary continental breakfast (in high season). My refund mentions that the hotel waived the non-refundable payment to make room. And likely charged a lot higher rate than he was getting from me.Booking.com responded:Romel P. from Customer Service\"Oh my. I'm  sorry to hear about your recent experience at GGT Tibet Inn. Rest assured we will submit a complaint about what happen. We will update you as soon as possible once we got a response from the property.

For years I used Booking.com as somehow they get hotels to match their cheapest rate, even though they are charging them a commission on your booking. Eventually, I figured out that hotels must only agree to this for the customer exposure, but ultimately it drives up room rates as hotels will have to charge more to cover the commission cost, meaning that by using these sites, the consumer is missing out. We are footing the bill for the commission paid to Booking.com ourselves.Furthermore, I got hit by a terrible case of the hotel that I booked (that cost \u00a31200) grossly misrepresenting itself. In UK law, it is illegal to misrepresent yourself as a business. Booking.com's response (after an extremely painful conversation with someone who could barely understand me) was that it says on their T&Cs that they are not liable for any misrepresentation by the hotel.My husband then went to his credit card issuer, to claim through them, but as Booking.com is the third party, and the credit card issuer can only recover costs when a hotel booking is made directly with a hotel, he was unable to claim for the cost of the hotel, purely because he used a third-party booking website, even though they deemed the case to be worthy of a refund.This means that if you use third party sites like Booking.com, you are paying to support an industry that drives up the price of hotel rooms, whilst also handing over any legal rights that you have through your credit card issuer, to a company that will close the door on you as soon as they have taken your money.It is only a matter of time before someone sues one of these third-party hotel booking websites for writing in their T&Cs that they are 'not liable for any misrepresentation by the hotel', which would be deemed an unfair term and be thrown out by any court, also resulting in these vultures receiving heavy fines - someone just needs to bring the court case and set the precedent so that these online booking websites can no longer get away with their dirty business practice.","review_rating":1,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":1726,"author":"Kerry","location":"unknown","date":"2021-11-04T13:25:33.000Z","headline":"Absolutely shocking customer service","review_body":"Absolutely shocking customer service, I spoken with a guy from Portugal who was laughing all the time on the call.Waiting for my money to be returned, I paid on my arrival at the hotel with a different card, so now booking.com are holding onto my money of \u00a3170 and they find it extremely funny for some reason.I will never use booking.com again please stay away from them .They just want to keep your money and offer no help.APPALLING","review_rating":1,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":1727,"author":"wadiaa ferzly","location":"unknown","date":"2021-11-04T10:42:28.000Z","headline":"the customers service","review_body":"the customers service is super bad, unreliable, they are not actually willing to assist customers.Please do not pay online through booking com because they will probably steal your money and will never be able to get it back. do not use booking com.","review_rating":1,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":1728,"author":"Fatimatuzzehra Guler","location":"unknown","date":"2021-11-04T10:41:47.000Z","headline":"I booked flights on booking.com but\u2026","review_body":"I booked flights on booking.com but they converted my name by adding extra characters and they say they can't refund although this is completely their fault.

Worse still, we were offered no compensation or even a small goodwill gesture when a mistake made by reception staff meant another couple were given our room key and walked in on me in the shower, then got nasty as they thought I was in \u2018their\u2019 room. The hotel point blank refused any sort of resolution but promised the manager would call me the next day to discuss my complaint. He didn\u2019t, and when I phoned to chase, the phone was slammed down as soon as I said why I was calling. I assumed booking.com would want to be aware of the incident with the other guests,  the fact that their webpages for the hotel are completely misleading and the fact that the hotel has such a poor approach to resolving complaints. I emailed them and received two emails within the next few days saying that booking.com customer services believed I should be given a full refund by the hotel and they would pursue this for me. Sounded good. Five weeks then went by with no update. After chasing twice more, I received an email from booking.com last week saying they can\u2019t contact the hotel (?!) so I can\u2019t have a refund but could have the \u2018maximum available compensation\u2019 of \u00a321 in cash. I replied to say I rejected this offer and still wanted a full refund. Booking.com then issued 21 EUROS to my account (\u00a317) as a credit to be used against a future stay - so not even the \u00a321 cash originally promised! Further communication has resulted in a series of automated responses telling me to contact the hotel with my complaint - so right back to square one.I\u2019ve booked dozens of times with booking.com in the last few years assuming I would always be protected by them if something went wrong with one of their properties, but how wrong I was.

This due to covid didn't happen.  18 months later a trip was planned for this weekend (23\/10\/21)  I booked our hotel through booking.com months in advance.  Very often I have used them, I have even helped booked trips for family.  Just after 11pm on 20\/10\/21 I received an email (if I didn't have my notifications on I would not have received it until the morning as I was half asleep) from booking.com stating my booking had been cancelled as they could not take payment from my card.  I was distraught.  I tried phoning the hotel that night who advised me I had to pick it up with booking.com.  The next morning I got through, I thought great I will get it booked again.  Long story short I was told my original pay method had been declined that's why I had my booking cancelled.  I said I changed my card details at the beginning of the week in anticipation of payment going out as I did not want to use the card I used months ago to book.  I was told the \"system\" several times would pick up the original card and that it had to be a credit card and not a debit card.  I argued the point that I should not have been able to change the details in that case, I even had an email confirming I had successfully updated my card details. I also argued it was nonsense not to be able to use a debit card.  The representative said once a booking had been cancelled they could no longer reinstate it and that the hotel was now fully booked. I stated it was not my fault they used the wrong card, however I didn't get anywhere and incidentally lost my booking.  All hotels appear fully booked or triple in price.  I will never use booking.com again.

I read the email only two days before arrival as I was extremely busy with the tour and thought it was just a reminder of our booking. Once I realised it was an out right cancellation I started immediately trying to book alternative places, as the place booking.com suggest had no longer space for all of us, as well as they didn't have separate beds, which is our main requirement: we needed separate beds, but could share rooms. At this stage I ccould literally not find anywhere for us to stay, Premier In was booked up, Holiday had no space for all of us either. So I realised we won't be able to stay all together, unless we stayed miles out of Hull in the country side, which wasn't possible as we didn't all have cars and we needed to be able to walk back to our accommodation at 11pm after doing our performances. I called the hotel back that booking.com recommended, they said they didn't have space, but had some space in their two sister hotels. I went for it and had to book one extra room in a the Holiday In to fit us all, as well as buy blow up mattresses to put in the hotel rooms to fit more people in, which the hotel kindly agrees to.The new bill was way above the original \u00a3664,70 I paid. So I ask booking.com to reimburse me for the additional costs incurred. Seeing as I not only spent lots more money, but also had to spend an incredible stressful day booking this while I was meant to do other work, as well as that we wouldn't be able to stay all together which was highly inconvenient for us and made some of us feel very unsafe!Booking.com refused this and when I said I wouldn't accept this they just kept sending me the same response instead of referring me to a manager or someone in higher authority as I asked for.Their reason for refusing is that the new places found were a lot more expensive and not the one they suggested. As explained above, the hotel suggested by them didn't have enough space for us, nor did it meet our requirments. I lost additional \u00a31500 due to something completely out of my control and am furious, but not surprised about this treatment.","review_rating":1,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":1844,"author":"Talha Dikici","location":"unknown","date":"2021-10-19T18:09:40.000Z","headline":"Very bad customer satisfaction","review_body":"Photos of booked hotel on the website far from reality.

In the space provided for comments, I stated that I would be transporting a bike box and gave the measurements, and asked that I be provided with a vehicle with the boot\/trunk space for it to fit in. When the Taxi arrived it was immediately apparent that it was not big enough. However, with my help, we squeezed the bike box on to the back seat, leaving about 4\" at best for my wife and I to sit. However on the return journey, though the driver acknowledged that he had seen the note about the bike box, it did not fit into his boot, and he refused to take us. Fortunately there was a Taxi rank nearby, and we hired another Taxi with a bigger boot. I contacted Booking.com on my return to explain what had happened, not looking for compensation, just a refund for the Taxi which refused to take us. I was quoted lines from their terms and conditions, which, according to Booking.com meant it was my fault for booking the wrong size Taxi. I reiterated the fact that I had told them about the oversized luggage and that I would have expected someone to recommend the appropriate vehicle, but they were just not interested, and just kept passing the buck. One email said I should have informed them in writing. I was under the impression that an email was writing!! I've been a loyal customer for many years (apparently a genius!!) which also entitles me to 10% discount on Taxi fares. What a con!! The replacement (larger) Taxi I had to hire was exactly the same price as the one I had prepaid, and would have actually been marginally cheaper had we not been held up in traffic due to an accident.

But not for Booking.com who attempt to put you under soo much pressure that you feel forced to cancel your booking. The approach from customer service was very unpleasant with agents that just had 1 goal to get you to cancel the booking. They repeat the same thing, do not know the facts and refused to listen to the customer. I asked to speak to a manager which they couldn't do for this issue. Last agent I spoke to refused to end the conversation until I had confirmed to cancel the booking, eventually the line went dead.Booking dot com has passed it's use by date and will probably drown in its own misery.

I booked a hotel room in Manchester called Central Suites through booking.com assuming that everything will be fine as booking.com is a worldwide company and checks the properties that are listed through the site. Once I booked the hotel I made my way to the address that was in booking.com , when I arrived to that address (9 Sudenhil Rd) I could only see a jewelry shop and no hotel to be found. I then called the number of the hotel ( a mobile and not a landline) and they were asking me for 200 pounds deposit so they can give me the correct postcode. As you can understand I took this as another red flag and I felt unsafe to go through with the money transfer ( by the way they wanted the money in cash or transfer to a personal account) I also felt unsafe to stay there whatsoever so I decided to cancel thee booking 15 mins after I made it. I called the hotel and they referred me to. Booking.com as I made the reservation through them. I called booking.com and I spoke with a staff member that's she agreed that everything feels dodgy and she understood my side so she would ask her supervisors to help. After she spoke with the supervisors though she came back and said that basically they do business with the hotel for 2 years now and they taking the hotel's side. I then explained to the staff member again that they advertise a hotel that has no legit website, no legit address or phone number and the owner asks for 200 pounds cash so he can give the right address, and after I snooped in the reviews I saw that more people had the same problem. It was then that I asked to speak with her supervisors directly and when she asked them to speak with me they REFUSED to speak with me , something that is actually sad and embarrassing for them and shows exactly what kind of company they are. Even if they wouldn't want to take any action it's common courtesy to speak with a customer that is in distress and has issues of potential fraud from a hotel that you as booking.com advertise.

I have not previously had any particular issues until this year.I went to Canada in late 2021. Travelling solo on the road for all of my trip I relied on them heavily for places to stay along the route and my rental car booking.First issue was with my car booking. Right up until the point of departure it did not show as confirmed . Despite contacting customer service via their chatbot I received no replies over a seven day period and eventually had to track down a number to call them. The agent I spoke to was very good and assured me the car was confirmed despite what the site was saying. So first issue resolved but at my time and expense.The first motel was OK the second was poor but not totally awful The third one made Fawlty Towers ( if you know the comedy show) look like the Waldorf Astoria.The Frontier Motel in Revelstoke should simply not be listed on a site that uses the no holds barred legend of The best hotels at the best price. This place was nothing of the sort There was as far as I can gather somebody actually living in the room I was given. That aside it was frankly disgusting-  and at short notice at 7pm at night I was left to find alternative accommodation that left a big hole in my budget.Ok these things happen what disappoints me is the lacklustre response to my customer service complaint at Booking .com who said sorry - have thirty five Canadian dollars on credit for your next booking- this is about \u00a320, despite me having to pay \u00a3120 for alternative accommodation.In my complaint I suggested this motel should not be on their site. I pointed out that the restaurant listed with the motel is actually closed downI checked back today and the advert on their site ( The Best hotels at the Best price) still shows the restaurant.If you check the reviews you get some very short ones saying how this is good for the money, here's a TIP, change the reviews box and see the pages of 1star reviews for this place stating that it is \"stinky\" \"dirty\" \"rundown\" \"decrepit\" \" etc - see the reviews of people who left without staying or the guy who found a dirty needle in the bathroom, the girl who found debris pushed under the bed and so on. These reviews run to pages They also go back over a year saying the restaurant is closed.So Booking.com - The best hotels at the best price- are quite happy to misrepresent this property.This is also apparent when you do their feedback. They, - just like political survey people, angle the questions so there is always a positive to put forward whilst ignoring the negatives Put down a series of negatives and you keep getting \"bonus\" questions - a desperate. cynical attempt to find a positive to spin on their ratings. Ie my favourite, was the location good- yes the location might be good but what was the hotel like!! I took pictures of the room and posted them on the feedback They have yet to appear on the webpage.Meanwhile I am still waiting for an update from Booking.com customer service regarding my last message to them. So I will ask them something on here and see if they respond.Why are you misrepresenting this property on your website? In short throughout my trip most of the motels ranged from acceptable to very good, this one was horrendous. The response from customer service to the concerns has been lacklustre and ineffectual.Booking .com are not interested unless you're booking...and ticking all the right boxes on their feedback requests","review_rating":1,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":1936,"author":"Brenly Bernhard Jeganathan","location":"unknown","date":"2021-10-10T20:03:21.000Z","headline":"I booked a ticket for 5min ago","review_body":"I booked a ticket for 5min ago, and want to cancel the ticket and rebook, as I forgot to add my middlename, and they charged me 380 kr for that!

Had a long weekend booked (Fri to Sun) in Sep with friends for two apartments in Manchester since March 2021. However, the accommodation was cancelled at 8:30 am on the day of check-in citing the cancellation was due to maintenance. However as I was busy organising everything before the trip (kids, work, house and etc) and getting to Euston in time for the train to Manchester, I actually did not receive the message until 10 minutes before the train arrived at Manchester Piccadilly around 3:45 pm. As you can imagine, the next 2 hours was very stressful as we camped out in a pub by the train station to try and find alternative accommodation. Since it was freshers weekend back at University and people wanting to travel again for long weekends after COVID, options were limited and accommodations on Bookings.com and AirB&B were either of significant lower quality for the same price, too far out of Manchester City Center or over double  and in some cases \u00a31000 more for the equivalent accommodation. In the end we had to choose Saschas Hotel which was awful (just check the 6.5k feedback on Booking.com website). The queue to check in was outside the hotel lobby at one point, the breakfast in the morning was at a totally different hotel. Our weekend was totally ruined by this and I just don\u2019t believe the maintenance for the original property is not planned in advanced rather than on the morning of our stay at 8:30 am. Due to the late notice, you would have thought that Booking.com would have had the decency to call me directly to try and resolve the situation rather than by direct inbox message on my Booking.com account. The final slap in the face was receiving an email from customer service on the Monday to apologise after the event. It said \u201cWe\u2019re sorry to hear that Dream Apartments Manchester wasn\u2019t able to honour your reservation. We\u2019ve tried contacting you to discuss alternative options, but we were unable to reach you.We hope you've found an alternative accommodation without too much trouble. If you've paid any extra costs, please send us your receipts and we\u2019ll do our best to assist you. We may need to share them with the accommodation in order to confirm your claim.First of all, they did not try to contact me at all \u2013 that was a lie! Also, they cancelled on me and if I had done it to them, I would have still been charged but Booking.com gets to ruin my weekend away with friends without any compensation? On top of it, if I paid an extra \u00a31000 for the equivalent property, they would do their best to assist but what if it was refused then I would be \u00a31000 out of pocket as well as having my weekend ruined!

Be warned, they can just alter the terms and conditions you agreed to when you booked, they can take a payment from your bank account without your permission and they make mistakes which they do not want to rectify. Their customer service is unbelievably poor: ages waiting on the phone, they don\u2019t ring you back, poorly trained personnel and no effort to help you or correct their mistakes. Their managers don\u2019t want to take responsibility and talk to you. Our experience: a member of our travel group telephoned to move our booking dates by one day following our flights being changed. At the same time, without our permission,  they altered our booking terms and conditions from flexible cancellation to no cancellation and without the bank account holders permission just took full payment from their bank account. The payment was not due for another 7 months. Booking.com have admitted their error, but so far are refusing to reimburse us and to revert our booking terms and conditions to those we agreed to. We now have a large financial burden, no cancellation option and have suffered significant stress through this whole ordeal. All this through an error booking.com made. The company is not trustworthy and cares little about their customers.

BERG EN ZEE GUESTHOUSE IN GORDONS BAY, Cape Town, South Africa. At that time they listed full alarm system. We had all our laptops with us and valuables as we left the next day to Johannesburg. That night we woke up and in intruder was next to our bed. I screamed and was terrified and was feeling vulnerable as we were not fully dressed. My partner's quick thinking chased the intruder out the door and he left his laptop bag and left. However we realised that he stole my expensive Apple laptop. We could not get hold of the host as she did not tell us where to find her in this big guesthouse. We were so traumatised and we ran out the door to try and see if we can find the intruder. We later drove to the police station at 3 in the morning. The police sent out a task force to find the guy but could not get hold of him. The Gordonsbay police told me later that they might know who the intruder was as he targets that specific area in Gordonsbay. The host did not care. We basically paid for a nightmare night and did not even sleep much. She just manipulated a story that her insurance cannot pay for my losses. While we were eating breakfast she was in our room to check if we were telling the truth. Later on she admitted that here was footsteps up the wall where the intruder climbed up.  Now I had not luck with her and started to contact customer service at booking.com.. It was all a PR stunt. The one after the other consultant would mail me with false sympathy but nothing came of it. The one consultant even told me that he will talk to management as this is serious. They do not want to admit that it was false advertising on their site and that the guesthouse also lied about the full alarm system that was not even activated or there was no alarm system. Then they delayed me by asking me for a police report and photos. I send them all the info for them to ignore me and say I must talk to the guest house. I had no way to contact the guesthouse as they told me she just denied all my allegations and said it was not true.  So I suffered great loss and booking.com might have told the guest house to adjust her alarm system notes on their website. But I have proof and screenshots of them advertising safety and alarm system.  The host also lied to them and said she has been more than accommodating. It was the worse night of our life and no one cares... I am still traumatised and wake up at night in cold sweat. Worse is she  and booking.com made a money out of our losses. I feel helpless and cheated. As everyone just moved on and I suffered great business losses and are traumatised till this day.  The last feedback I received from Booking.com customer service was contact the guesthouse yourself. But I turned to booking.com after she was not helpful hoping that they will take responsibility as they listed alarm system on their website and surely checked that the Berg en Zee guesthouse in Gordonsbay told the truth.

At the time I was not paying that much attention to the pick-up time, but - as requested - I entered the flight number KL1725, which I was thinking was very important information as flights are cancelled and rescheduled, and the car rentals at the airport would then know exactly to be ready for the customer, if following the information about the arriving flights. Well, that was what I thought. However, it turned out that the rental was already closed when I arrived in the afternoon on Sunday, September 26, and the next morning there were no more cars available. Not such big deal - or so I thought - as Sixt rental never got any money, and I got a car from another rental. (Surely I tried to contact Booking.com and the rental Sixt already after I could not get a car, but all Sixt offices were closed and Booking.com has terribly bad Customer Service, which is difficult to be found. E.g. the phone number provided in the voucher does not work.)But now it seems to be very difficult to get my 2008.83 \u20ac back from Booking.com. I have been asked to wait until the intended return date of the car, which is October 23. Then I could send a claim. Processing of the claim takes 28 days, and the result cannot be promised by the Customer Service of Booking.com. That means I need to lend my money to them for nothing - not even promise to get my money back - at least for two months.I made a mistake not being punctual when entering the pick-up time, but it doesn't give right to Booking.com to hold my money as they didn't have to pay anything to the Rental.The whole concept of easy booking of cars, flights or hotels through one web-based agent is not feasible for me after this experience. I wonder, if it is legal to keep the payment for services never provided - even only temporarily (which I don't know). Of course it seems to be the standard that Booking.com people don't say they are sorry, but refer to the agreement, which I have approved, when I made the booking.I recommend to everyone from now on to use a real travel agent or book by yourself directly.

I still had a central location but no swimming pool. I worked in hospitality for years and this is not what I was expecting customer service wise.

However, the real rip-off is in the way they treat their accommodation providers, especially the smaller businesses.  They take 15% of what the customer pays and then charge the establishment a significant fee for handling the money, which they make sure they have held on to long enough to cream off another little bit in interest.  On top of that they are really quite inefficient, and, as a hotel owner (small 8 rooms), we are often having to deal with the consequences of their overbooking in the knowledge that the customer will think we have messed it up, not Booking.com.  My advicr to all clients would be: try to find the website of the place you think you would like to go to and book directly.  You will find that almost all hotels, restaurants etc. have human a being at the end of a phone line who can answer your questions and help you make the best decisions.  You may also find reductions or, in most cases, free breakfast and other offers - 15% plus handling fees remember! - most people would rather see their clients happier than pay it out to booking.  Always prefer a human being.

Often you find yourself talking to staff members who deny what a colleague of theirs said a little earlier, clutching at straws with unrealistic justifications. You are never assigned a ticket code of the issue you submit, so that every time you need to contact customer service, you find yourself talking to a different person and you have to start the explanation from scratch. If you ask that they formalize in writing the existence of a malfunction of the platform that they are willing to verbally acknowledge, they refuse to do so, being sure that they can make people believe they live in an ideal world free of imperfections.I highly recommend to all travelers who consult booking.com, to simulate a reservation through the platform for the structure they have chosen and then open a blank Google page and type in the name of the same property.In most cases, the traveler will find a webpage with the same photos and information available on booking.com, but also the telephone number of the strucure (hotel or apartment) of her or his interest.The traveler can directly call the structure to negotiate a significant discount on the rate appeared on booking.com. The host will be happy to lower the price, given that he will not have to pay booking.com the hefty (mostly tax-free) commission that this wealthy company collects in its head office based in the Nedetlands for tax reasons only.","review_rating":1,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":2244,"author":"Duncan L Geoghegan","location":"unknown","date":"2021-09-10T09:33:37.000Z","headline":"They host scam properties and take the commission","review_body":"Booked a hotel with these guys that turned out to be unfit for animals nevermind people.

I arrived to The Draper Hotel at 7pm this Friday September 3rd, 2021. Upon arrival I was told by the front desk that I did not in fact have a reservation for their hotel, leaving me stranded in Manhattan on a Friday night. I was informed by the receptionist that the issue has been ongoing since 11am that morning. An entire 8 hours passed from the onset of this issue and my arrival, and there was NOTHING being done to rectify the issue. I was offered the customer service number to booking.com and told that I will probably be given another hotel- probably. Frustrated and now left panicked that it was late and I had nowhere to stay I called the number to no avail. Nobody answered the line for an hour and it was now 8pm. The receptionist at the front said that the NH hotel around the corner may have available rooms, and that we should try there. Luckily they did have space, but it was significantly more expensive than my initial booking. If I had known in advance that The Draper Hotel would not have availability that night I could have found a better deal somewhere else. Baffled and having already paid in full for my room through booking.com I now had to shell out an additional $322 dollars just to have a place to sleep. My experience in Manhattan on Friday night was both stressful and frustrating, not knowing where I would be sleeping that night despite having done everything I could on my end to ensure a smooth check-in. The lack of coordination between your company and The Draper Hotel for those guests arriving under the assumption that they had a place to stay is absolutely unacceptable. There was no prior notice given and all of the guests who used your website found out they did not have a place to stay upon arrival. They have yet to respond to my claim for reimbursement.

That so called travel agency had charged the guest, but didn't care to pay to us. They provided unavailable or incomplete credit card details, did not respond to messages and lied to the guest on the phone saying they payed to Booking.com and they make business together with Booking.com so everything is ok. We had to charge the guest. That way the guest had to pay twice for their booking. We provided all necessary support to help the guest get a refund for their card payment to the fraudulent company so that part is settled.We reported to Booking.com our experience and the fraudulent activity the company is engaged in, hoping they will investigate and asking for an assurance for that on their part. Instead of taking ownership and starting to investigate the issue that some thieves are using the Booking.com platform to steal money from people, Booking.com tried to translate the responsibility to us, the property owners, who are victims of these fraudulent activities. All we got as an answer was the advise to setup a security deposit or simply to cancel a reservation. When I explained that this does not resolve anything, because the fraudulent company does not inform guests of cancelled reservations. Then again you are stuck with an arriving customer who has payed, their money is gone, and has no idea their booking is cancelled. A horrible situation for us, the property owners, and the guests. I received no more responses from Booking.com after sending to them this argument.This is not the first time we felt like Booking.com is avoiding responsibility for issues that happen on their platform, and to be honest we don't feel like our rights are well protected.","review_rating":1,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":2301,"author":"Anthony Hampson","location":"unknown","date":"2021-09-06T07:05:08.000Z","headline":"Booking.com Finance dept","review_body":"I list with Booking.com and usually think there service is ok , even though commission rates are high.

Their pricing is no longer trustworthy. I have lost all faith in the company. I booked a hotel for xx amount and received a confirmation email containing the amount stated at checkout, BUT, my credit card was charged a completely different amount!! I'm unsure how this is legal or possible - to show me one amount when entering my credit card, then to email me a confirmation with the same amount shown at checkout, BUT then to charge my credit card a completely different amount. In this case the amount was about $75 more than the agreed price stated at checkout, for a one night stay! The difference was huge. I get notifications on my phone when I use my credit card, so immediately the notification appeared on my phone and within 5 minutes I called booking.com to inquire about the charge and cancel the booking. I spent hours on the phone with booking.com who gave me the run around.  What was most frustrating was that the customer service rep and her manager acknowledged that the amount on the website was the correct amount and that they were not sure why I was being charged a different amount. After booking.com called the hotel, the hotel stated that there were other fees, including extra taxes, service and cleaning fees that we're not stated on booking.com but should have been included in that price... It turns out the hotel was new to the platform and didn't enter the information correctly so the price didn't show correctly. EVEN SO, BOOKING.COM AND THE HOTEL REFUSED TO CANCEL MY RESERVATION. Even though both parties we're at fault.. yet somehow I got stuck paying $75+ extra for a 1 night stay. I also couldn't believe they refused to cancel when I called them 5 minutes after booking to address the issue.

I\u2019m lucky at least it\u2019s before I got anywhere and not sleeping on the streets like some poor people even with children I\u2019ve read about in foreign countries. At now 1.32 am I\u2019ve been offered 25 euro refund which I said I\u2019ll take and send the bill for the rest of my trip as I can\u2019t stay awake a minute longer. If they don\u2019t pay I will make a claim in small claims court and expect compensation and costs paid! On hold for some reason waiting for a supervisor I feel sorry for anyone abroad having to go through this God help them.

You also refused to just transfer our booking elsewhere which is what we wanted - instead you offered to refund the money which will take a number of days (not good enough, the trip away is the next day, hence why a transfer would\u2019ve been simpler for ourselves and your company), and sent us a possible alternative which you may give us a \u2018possible refund\u2019 of the extra if we invoice you but we have to fork out upfront with no guarantee of a refund and no idea of when that may be paid. The alternative you suggested was nearly \u00a3500 which having already paid for one apartment which we are now waiting for money back on, and this being way out of our budget regardless and significantly more expensive than our original apartment we simply cannot do, especially with the refund afterwards being \u2018possible\u2019 not \u2018guaranteed\u2019. We have had no choice but to book significantly cheaper accommodation elsewhere which is still more expensive than our original choice due to the short notice, and you obviously won\u2019t help us with the costs for because it\u2019s not somewhere ridiculously expensive that you have recommended. We had already paid for travel and booked things for during our stay which we couldn\u2019t afford to lose money on, therefore cancelling the trip wasn\u2019t really an option either. We will now be a further \u00a3117 out of pocket. To add insult to injury you are STILL advertising the apartment on your site for the next few days even though the host has definitely told you now he cannot have guests at the minute. I think it\u2019s absolutely disgusting how you dealt with us, you have found no satisfactory resolution, you all just kept repeating yourselves instead of finding a new option to help, we weren\u2019t believed in the first instance and have wasted several hours on the phone with you to just be left more frustrated and upset. My wife and I, and our friends will not be using yourselves anymore which is a shame because until this point I have always booked through you, and I will be making sure as many people are aware of how we have been treated as possible so they don\u2019t use you either. To be compensated somehow or have some sort of gesture of goodwill from yourselves for the extra costs we are incurring, the time we have wasted trying to resolve this, and the stress due to the appalling way this was handled would be appreciated.","review_rating":1,"num_like":1,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":2404,"author":"Hussein Sacranie","location":"unknown","date":"2021-08-28T02:37:44.000Z","headline":"AVOID BOOKING.COM","review_body":"Booked a room when i got there the hotel said they had no booking.

They stole my money. I booked a car rental in San Diego about a month in advance. They instantly charge my CC $270 for a four day rental. When I arrived to San Diego and went to the car rental company (Mex Rent a car) The lady was rude and insisted I purchase their insurance at $80 per day rate. I explained that my insurance carrier covered rentals and she became upset. She demanded proof of insurance. I showed her my insurance card on my app from my insurance, but she said that was not enough. I then showed her where the listed covered drivers were and she stated that she could not accept that either. She once again told me to purchase their insurance and I told her I was not going to because my insurance covered rentals. She then said nothing and cancelled my reservation and I was stranded. I called booking.com and was on hold to speak to someone for an hour and 40 minutes. When I finally spoke to someone, they told me all I could do is wait until my rental period was over (4 days) and then file a complaint online on their website. I did that. I received an email about 3 weeks later that they would \"investigate\". I then received another email shortly after stating that they needed my flight information and the time I showed up to pick up the vehicle. I sent them that information. I then had to wait another couple of weeks before they sent me any type of response. The last response told me that the car rental company had up to 30 days to respond. I emailed them once again asking why was taking so long. I told them that I was not provided with a vehicle and that I was owed $270. They did not provide a service to me and it was through no fault of my own. I received a call from Ruan about a week after I emailed them. He told me that they had concluded the investigation and that they decided I was at fault because I did not provide a letter from my credit card company stating that I was insured and able to drive the vehicle. I have never heard of such nonsense and I have rented many cars in my life. I told him I provided the proper insurance information and that the clerk just cancelled my reservation. I once again told them it was not my fault and that I did not receive a rental and that I needed to get refunded. He asked me if I had called from the counter and I told him yes but that I was kept on hold for almost two hours. Ruan asked me if I had proof of that phone call. How am I suppose to have proof of being on hold for nearly two hours two months prior. This company is completely unreasonable. I asked for a supervisor and he rudely told me that if I spoke to a supervisor they were just going to tell me the same thing. I then told him I needed to speak to someone that made better decisions. He told me that he could create a ticket and then have a supervisor call me at some time in the future. He said he did not know when because they were extremely busy. The following day Ruan called me again and told me that the supervisor was NOT going to speak to me and that the decision was final and I could do nothing. My only options were to get refunded for only one day  ($67) or nothing at all. I told him that I needed to get the entire refund not just one day. He told me I violated the terms. Ruan was frustrated with me and he told me he was not going to go back and forth with me and that was it. This company stole my money. I did nothing wrong. I showed proof of insurance. I was treated very poorly and was left stranded. This company is an absolute fraud. I would never recommend this to any person for a hotel, or vehicle.

They tend to just transfer your requests to another department and then another or you get a link to some useless online form and chatbots that don't help at all. Plus it takes forever to reach anyone, so I'm really really disappointed with the service and will now start using other booking platforms with (hopefully) more customer-oriented approach as there's enough competition ont he market. They also seem to be extremley unaligned with actual hotels as I've experienced many times that the hotel claims extra taxes at checkout and insists that breakfast was not included in the rate even though Booking.com's confirmation clearly states that all these chargers are included in the final price. Thus I encourage everyone to make screeshots when booking and making sure you keep all your booking confirmations saved on your mobile or printed to hand them to the hotel staff if they charge you more than they should. It's really frustrating that we as customers and guests have to bear this issues, but unless they resolve this on their side, I cannot give a positive mark as my experience is many times ruined by this lack of help and unwillingness to create a better overall customer experience.","review_rating":1,"num_like":2,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":2445,"author":"Emily ","location":"unknown","date":"2021-08-24T11:11:36.000Z","headline":"What do booking.com do?","review_body":"Hi we booked a three night stay in an Italian hotel.

The automated email, from the owner stated that the keys were in a locked box on the wall at the house and needed a PIN code. The owner seemed friendly and there was a mobile number and email to contact owner with queries, such as where to eat out. I phoned number which did not have a personalised message, to ask for the PIN and left a message with my number and email for contact. Next day no response so tried them both again and then contacted booking.com by phone, which is well hidden on their site. Explained I was getting worried as not had response and did not want to travel over 200 miles and not have access to property. Agent phoned owner and left message! Over next few days none of my calls and emails through booking. Com website were answered.Surely booking.com would check the contact details for the owner, both mobile and email to check they were working? They assured me all properties are vetted but some reviews had pointed out some minor fixture and fittings issues. I was getting panicky as no contact, but booking.com said it was not a problem we should check in16.00. If access could not be gained they would try to contact owner again with one final email and phone call, and if no response, after 30 minutes would try to get us another property off their site or other \u2018platform.\u2019 This was worrying as lots of places were booked as it was school,holidays. This would all be done while we are sat outside in our car! We would still have to book this through their site and pay for it! They would then pay the difference when I send them an invoice.  They did not understand that we did not want to drive such a difference with the chance of getting in. First agent based in Singapore and chat agent in Holland. The day before I was considering booking another place but fortunately I did not as was sceptical of recovering money. On the morning of travel received automated email from owner at 08.57 with the PIN so we got in on arrival. The property was ok but some of the repairs to showers and fittings still not done. After a couple of days there we got email saying my request had been passed in to the owner! A complete disregard of the fact we were already in the property. I wasted hours trying to chase owner and went round in circles trying to get answer.The property still had shower panels missing and some metal door handles were glued on with wood glue but as there were only three of us in property it did not affect us and the property was very good. Dealing with booking.com was very frustrating as they only act as agent and despite them pressing for answers none were received.

There were none of the above items and the disappointment on my husband's face was terrible to see! No pool or jacuzzi were available just a dirty, dark cottage with a tiny balcony and no view because of the overgrown trees in the neighbouring gardens! After a 7 hour long drive and with no choice we stayed one night! Then went to friends to decide what to do. Imagine the shock when we returned to find the owner had rebooked the property to a Dutch client and all the food and some personal items were \"gone\" I then had to hastily find alternative accommodation and was not surprised to find a review on booking.com by the dutch client echoing my feelings. We both agreed it was dirty! Unsuitable and the owner was aggressive and abusive when we both asked for refunds as 700\u20ac for one sleepless night is unacceptable! I have of course complained to booking.com and have heard nothing for almost a month so don't expect a refund or booking.com to do anything about this situation. I am however in touch with the Carcasonne prefecture who according to government officials are keen to deal with this type of scam as it is fraud. I feel terribly let down by booking.com and will not be using them again in the future and advise anyone to be careful as the advertising is certainly not accurate in many cases, and they need to get their inspection of properties advertised done regularly to protect their customers. A poor service and no interest in resolving problems!!!

If they wanted on purpose to do something totally bad and deficient, I'm not sure they could do it any better.Be warned, everything will fail, they will not answer, and if they do, they will actually tell you that it's your fault if their app bugs, if they do mistakes, or if they are unreachable, instead of apologizing!This is one of the worst customer service I saw in my life (when you actually can talk to a support, I am currently trying to call their hotline that is advertised as available 24\/7, but the call doesn't even connect since this morning, you just get a robot saying no one is available hahaha)Some more facts about my most unpleasant adventure with Booking, for the fans of absurd, Kafka, and big corporations lying to and stealing paying customers:- I booked a hotel, and chose to pay a bit higher price, because it was supposed to include a free taxi ride from the airport (to register 48h prior to arrival)- At the right time, &lt 48h prior, when I wanted to confirm the taxi ride, the start seemed nice, I could fill in flight number and all information... then at the last step of the form, I got an error message \"Unknown error, please retry later\"- I retried many times, I tried on a different name, etc, nothing worked- I could only access the application at this time, and it was impossible to find one phone number to contact, one email address, one chat, nothing, so after many tries I could only give up- The next day, I tried again from my computer, of course it was too late so the free option was unavailable, but I did find a phone number to call- I talked to a 1st lady about my issue, saying that I had a screenshot of the bug of the application, but she was very insistent that it was my own fault, that she couldn't find a trace of my free taxi ride, and that a screenshot with a page of their own application that had the title \"FREE TAXI RIDE\" and the error message was not receivable... even when I tried to say, well how could have I arrived on this page if I didn't have the option, or when I defended that Booking should know what is on their website, not me, I got no apologies, she was very sure it was my own fault, and of course could not transfer me to anyone else in charge- Luckily, I could find again the initial e-mail including the written free taxi ride, so I called Booking again, and I talked to a nicer agent.. Spent 1h on the phone, sent her the screenshot, she went to an expert... to finally tell me they could not do anything, because I was calling them too late (of course, since the numbers are impossible to find!!). It ended up with a promise, not even of a refund, or anything, but of APPLYING for a refund (let's see if they are gonna scam me again)Then, it's not over... this is where I did a stupid mistake, because I thought I would go through Booking again to book a paid ride from the airport... Thinking naively that going with the same operator would allow me more easily to be paid back and get my promised gratuity. What a deep deep error.At 1st, everything seemed fine, the taxi was booked and registered... the issue arrived when our initial flight was delayed, the connecting flight postponed, and we had to try reaching Booking to change the arrival time!Then the same crazy story starts all over again:- When you go to manage your booking on their app, they'll say that the time is too short to update online, so you should contact them directly (this is when you start knowing you will get scammed again by these thieves!)- Again, impossible to find one chat, you look for the help and land on a page saying \"how can we help you?\" like there would be a form to fill, but no form, just an empty page...- I did find 2 numbers on the booking taxi \"manage your reservation\" thing, one number from Booking itself, and one from the taxi company \"grand class\" (very ironic name)- Of course, the number from Booking is the one that is not connecting for the whole day, and actually impossible to reach! So you can't do any changes, and the 24\/7 support is just a huge scam!- Then you call the taxi company, the 2nd number displayed.. people actually answer, and are much nicer.. but they tell you they can't do anything, and that you should talk with Booking (lol)- You will try explaining to the taxi company that Booking is impossible to reach, that they are so bad nothing works, and that you have to change the reservation otherwise one taxi will go to the airport for nothing, while the same ride will be needed a few hours later...- The taxi company will take your reservation number, and promise that Booking should call you back quickly- Do you think Booking called back? anyone wants to bet? of course they never did","review_rating":1,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":2498,"author":"MC","location":"unknown","date":"2021-08-19T17:11:58.000Z","headline":"Incorrect information in their hotel listings and no help or resolution","review_body":"Have used them for 1-night stays for years with no problem, but a 2-week hotel booking has ended in disaster, so never again.We booked and paid for 14 nights at a hotel in Elounda, Crete which advertised a pool.

No mention in any documentation that I received that I should bring both parts of my driving licence with me to the airport. On 28th June 2021 my family and I arrived at Bristol Airport to start our holidays after a difficulty year with covid and my husband lost his young sister to cancer so we were really looking forward to a break away. We arrived at SIXT desk to be told they couldn\u2019t rent the car to me as I didn\u2019t have both parts of my licence. I was very upset and stressed as I had a young child with me and our accommodation was 3 hours away. The SIXT representative was very apologetic and helpful. He went to an adjoining car rental desk Enterprise and they were able to rent me a car without both parts of the licence. We had already paid \u00a3281.87 well in advance to rent car from SIXT and were left with no choice but to pay the extortionate amount of \u00a3701.50 to rent a car from Enterprise at the last minute. I have sent 7 emails to booking.com along with a letter of complaint but all I get back are generic emails from them looking a pin number which we haven\u2019t got ad this has been explained to them several times. We have tried ringing but you can\u2019t connect to a customer advisor without a pin number. I am claiming a full refund of \u00a3271.87 for a car we weren\u2019t able to rent and also \u00a3419.63 which is the extra money we had to spend to rent the other car. I should not suffer a financial detriment because booking.com did not make me aware that you needed to bring both parts of the licence. Both booking.com and SIXT need to update their instructions specific to Northern Ireland customers as it is unclear and misleading. A company adjacent to SIXT were able to offer us a car without both parts of the licence so clearly one rule for one and one for another. It jaded our holiday and caused unnecessary stress financially. I have been left very frustrated by booking.com they have not acknowledged my letter nor the emails I have sent. It would appear that they have no intention of addressing my concerns and hope that I will just give up and go away but I have no intention of doing that.

Why they let me take those date if it's already taken !?2nd problem : During this phone call, they said to me that they will send me other reservation that are similar. The phone call stop and when I have checked the proposals: it is less well placed and more than twice the price of the original reservation (which was already expensive). So I gave up to find other reservation on their site.3rd problem : I gave up their website, but my reservation is still active and needs to be canceled. Problem : when I click on the button to undo this reservation, it said to me that it will send an email to confirm my decision. I never receive any other mail from booking since their other proposals, so, since the end of July, I tried more than ten times to cancel my reservation without it working.4th problem : Sometimes I saw that the site tells me that I need to contact the guys who own the house to confirm the cancellation. But when I click on the button to contact him, it send me on their \"Message\" option, but I can't write any message.5th problem : Sometimes, still to be able to cancel my reservation, the site tells me to contact customer service. When I click on the button to do it, it send me on the FAQ of the website so it won't help me. But a button to contact them directly exist ! When I click on it : it send me on the same \"Message\" option, so like the 4th problem, I can't contact them by writing. So when I want to contact them by phone, only one number is free.

Today, for the first time, I discovered what this company is like if you have a query.  The experience was enough to ensure that I will never again use their services. Simply the worst customer service you can imagine. I used Kayak to look for a one-way car hire deal and it quoted an all inclusive price of \u00a3149, before passing me through to Booking.com.  I proceeded to book - at \u00a3148.50 - on Booking.com and, after a short time, I received my confirmation email.  I was surprised to see that the email mentioned an extra \u201cone-way\u201d charge of \u00a348 that it said I needed to pay on collecting the car.  I knew for certain that the one-way fee had been in the price quoted.  I was able to replicate the deal by going through another quotation and, sure enough, it stated that the one-way fee was included.  It therefore seemed likely that the email from Booking.com was in error, but I thought I\u2019d better check. On contacting the customer support team via web chat, and waiting ages in a queue, I was told that the \u00a348 did indeed apply and that I needed to \u201caccept it\u201d on the website.  The agent didn\u2019t seem to know which website he was talking about or where I would accept it, and then the chat disconnected. I decided to call customer services by phone, instead. I thought that the original agent must have misunderstood the issue.  After another long wait in a queue, I explained everything again to the phone agent and pointed out that the \u00a3148.50 that I had been quoted seemed to have turned into \u00a3196.50.  She offered no explanation for this and insisted it was all part of the car hire firm\u2019s terms and conditions!  When I asked her to cancel the booking, she told me I would receive no refund! I pointed out that this was tantamount to fraud, but she followed her script telling me that I had accepted the terms etc.! 2 further web chats were needed before I finally got an agent (thanks Lloyd) to grudgingly agree to cancel and refund the money at some point in the next 5 working days.  No apology. No explanation for the ridiculous attitude adopted. Incidentally, the car rental company was Budget and its own website offered exactly the same deal - \u00a3148.50 - inclusive of a \u00a340 one-way fee.  So I\u2019m 99.9% certain that the Booking.com email just contained an error.  But the shocking lack of knowledge of the customer service team and the cavalier attitude towards misrepresentation means I can never again use this organisation.","review_rating":1,"num_like":1,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":2584,"author":"barbara boyce","location":"unknown","date":"2021-08-12T20:42:47.000Z","headline":"Not happy with customer services\u2026.","review_body":"Not happy with customer services\u2026.Never had a problem and have used booking.com several times over the years.

Unfortunately I was on the phone for more than a hour being transferred and left on hold from team member to team member. I spoke with a Nicole and a Kira, I was then told by Kira that Nicole said there was not a manger on site. I was also told that they were booked to capacity. I was frustrated because I was being charged more through a third party than I would have been charged through IHG. Once arriving I was checked in by a very nice young lady named Shalise. She was new but she went above and beyond to help me. I explained that I was to have a two bedroom she explained that what was booked through the third party was a one bedroom with two beds. I asked to speak with the manager it took about 30 minutes for Darrion to come over. I explained the situation to him, I showed him the time stamp on my phone of how long I had been being left on hold. He said he knows the two young ladies and he would speak with them. He never offered to charge me the rate of a IHG member he said I can charge you $120.00 more dollars to correct the room. The room I was assigned to was dirty. The ceiling in the living room next to the sliding door looks soft with a dip like it would cave in. Spider Webs were on the lamp shade, hair in the bathroom sink and shower. The carpet was filthy!!! I feel I was purposely assigned to a few of there worse rooms by Darrion. My room # was 2200 Springer from 8-5 to 8-8 . I heard him talking about some rooms being recently remodeled . He explained to the front desk girl that she would know by color if it\u2019s blue or green. The towels didn\u2019t look clean, I called the front desk I was told that they do not give new towels we would need to was and dry them. I explained to her that we had been gone to Disney springs all day. We never used the towels so why would we wash them. We needed a frying pan to make breakfast for the kids. We were advised they were out of frying pans. Later we were told they found a pan we could used but was warned that it was stainless steel. We needed the sheet for the sofa bed that had a huge brown stain on the mattress. We were told they only had one runner at night and it would take about 45 minutes. I asked if I could pick it up I was told NO. I have stayed here several times, I have never had a experience such as this.

I have used booking.com in the past a few times with no problem. Looking for somewhere to celebrate my husbands and my 20th wedding anniversary, I came across a hotel on booking.com it said I wouldn\u2019t need to pay until after my stay but requested my bank details to guarantee and to be able to book. I understood the purpose of this and proceeded to book. I was surprised on finishing to notice on my receipt I had in fact been charged for my booking, despite saying I wouldn\u2019t be. I decided not to follow this up as my husband and I were looking forward to our night away and were unlikely to cancel. The day before our stay someone in my husbands office at work who he\u2019d had contact with tested positive to COVID and he was sent home from work to isolate. We therefore had to cancel. I firstly phoned the hotel who said as he booking was organised through booking.com they could not organise a refund however booking does not pay for the booking until after our stay so they had no been paid yet and under these circumstances they would not charge so if I spoke to booking they may still be able to refund me. All I had to do was speak to booking and cancel and the rest should be sorted out.I did as she suggested and rang, the automated  message said they were experiencing lots of calls and I could be waiting 20 mins, I waited beyond 20 mins and gave up then tried again later with the same. I then went onto my booking.com account and then noticed I have been charged and my receipt said I was not entitled for a refund. I tried to call again following this and the same happened, I did not get to speak to anyone, the next day and it said 5 mins but waited again for around 30mins with no answer.  I find it appalling that I have not been able to talk to someone to get a refund. That I gave my bank details thinking I would be guaranteeing my stay not paying for it. That I have paid for something booking,com will not have been charged for. And that in these current climates with people having to cancel at short notice with COVID related issues booking.com are able to sell bookings with no easy method of being refunded.

I immediately looked up my rights and learnt that (according to the Consumer Rights Act 2015) I had a right to a choice between a full refund or substitute accommodation that was as good in quality and as good of a location as my original booking, as well as encoring no extra cost to my original payment. The trader is to pay the difference.Over 6 hours on hold later - so to cut a very long story short - I was led round in circles, booking.com never responded to emails and would only phone me with their responses (so I started recording our phone calls in prep for the court case).They ended up never replying to me emails or phone calls, blocked on some numbers.They left me stranded and homeless, with no international minutes left to call them with (they don't have a UK phone number and just don't respond to emails). They told me 2 different reasons for the cancellation - emergency maintenance and overbooking, so somewhere a lie was going on although the reason for cancellation was none of my business all that concerned me was where I was going to stay instead as I had already paid in full).They had 8 alternative accommodations available on their website but wouldn't give them to me as they were 'too expensive' - I know that they're extortionate, obviously booking hotels the day before is exceptionally expensive, that's why I didn't do that and booked months in advance! That's why I was was explicitly requesting that I didn't get a refund - the money I paid a month ago would neverrrr cover the cost of the same nights away booked the day before check in!Instead, they 'offered' me an Airbnb - which I don't consider an offer as they were asking me to enter a new contract that had nothing to do with them, meaning that they could very easily not refund me for it, leading me to losing an awful lot of money.

Booking.com refusing any sort of refund, compensation or even to remove the  of the listing. I emplore everyone to report booking.com to the their relevant Consumer Market Authority. For the UK, this is the CMA, and you can report them for not having clear information (i.e. \"accurate\" and \"not misleading, both in action or omission\").More information: none of the following were provided in the property despite being listed - safety deposit box (I consider essential for passport, valuables, etc), television, pay-per-view service, streaming service, mosquito net, fireplace. Booking tried to claim that it was possible that some of these features may have temporarily been missing - how they deem a structural feature like a fireplace might have possibly been temporarily removed is beyond me. After the first phone call asking the property about the missing items (to which, they feigned not speaking English, but being conversational Spanish, I just asked in Spanish instead), they admitted they were missing then hung up. The property won't accept any of my calls now, and the person here states they are only the manager and that the issue is with the owner. Booking.com also contacted them, to which they admitted to them that the information was inaccurate, but after them asking for a cancellation (on the first day) then requesting early check-out (which they completely ignore), the property is then just refused their calls too. Despite this and calls each day to Booking.com, the advert is still up, with all the false information. I have been trying to get Booking.com to remove the listing and in allowing it to continue (despite the property admitting it was false) Booking.com is knowingly compliant with this fraudulent activity.Again, I implore everyone to report Booking.com to the Consumer Market Authority.","review_rating":1,"num_like":1,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":2748,"author":"Easy-Rider","location":"unknown","date":"2021-07-31T16:26:58.000Z","headline":"Do not trust this company","review_body":"I do not trust this company and will never use again.

My experience: I booked a hotel room with \u201cHotel Torres Del Mar in Puerto Viejo, Costa Rica\u201d via booking.com. Upon confirmation, I notice that almost all reviews show that the hotel has been trapping tourists using deceptive pictures. I immediately raised my concerns over this to the hotel but instead of answering my question, the hotel immediately took my money from the credit card I saved, and came back to me with a delayed response telling me that tourists who posted the reviews misunderstood general pictures for the rooms. I have checked other portals such as Expedia and Google Map, and I am pretty sure that reviews on all these different platforms have been pointing out the same thing that the hotel is using fake pictures, among its many other problems in aspects of sanitation, security, rudeness, electric wires exposure on the shower, and trying to scam the tourists for money. All these comments are well-written by authentic real users from worldwide. In order to avoid further risks and unpleasantness, I requested the hotel to cancel my booking and refund the amount of money they have just took a few minutes ago (it is still 4 days before check-in). But the hotel replied with again a delayed response saying that I have missed the 1 hour cancellation period (which is unreasonably short anyway), and they refuse to communicate with me, telling me to contact booking.com. I contacted booking.com but was only replied with my request for cancellation denied, and they cannot do anything about this. By the time, 20 hours have passed since I proposed my request. I feel the hotel is only intentionally delaying everything so that cancellation would be less possible. This behavior only strengthened my impression that the hotel is trying to fish tourists and rob them. I actually already feel unsafe if I would have to stay there. I am only left with the option between staying with the trapping hotel which I do not trust, or giving up to its deceptive and bully behavior by feeding them with the $165 they have taken for the reservation. I feel this is very unfair. I understand the reservation rule is to protect the guests to secure a room and help the hotel to prepare by not overselling the rooms, but this hotel is obviously making misuse of such mechanism. Moreover, I would like to question the rules of booking.com, which says it cannot do anything in this incident given all above facts that prove this is a scam. I feel the website is not protecting the vulnerable consumers but only the interests of hotels, even obviously dishonest hotels. Although reviews accumulated for many years all display that the hotel has been deceiving and mistreating its consumers. I feel been forced to walk into such a trap even though I have already discovered immediately after the booking, and communicated with all these different parties. While booking.com only acts to protect and support the fraud and robbing of its hotel users by replying to consumers that there is nothing it can do. Note that pictures serve as the most important information source for making decisions in an Internet business like this, and booking.com has been ignoring the complaints over deceptive pictures for many years. When incidents happen, it does not do anything to help the consumer but comply with the hotel, despite that the website is aware of what is the essence of this incident.  I wish booking.com to stop the transaction at this moment, cancel my reservation with full refund, before further harm could occur and help to protect my safety. It might perhaps also consider to fix the deceptive pictures, and give an honest description and rating of the hotel (and make the information obvious) so that there will be no other victims in the future. It could perhaps also review its measurements and procedures to protect consumers against such trapping and deceptive behaviors. So far I have received no reply.","review_rating":1,"num_like":1,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":2769,"author":"JL","location":"unknown","date":"2021-07-29T21:33:56.000Z","headline":"So I booked an apartment in london for\u2026","review_body":"So I booked an apartment in london for 4 nights and then discussed for an extended stay.

(+ 44 20 3320 2609. I think?)at \u201cThe Chatsworth Hotel\u201d Weymouth 14 The Esplanade, Weymouth, Dorset, DT45 8EB UK. Telephone No. +447977 69948, at a cost of \u00a3440.00. For four days from  10th June -14th June 2021 on Bed & Breakfast terms with all normal hotel facilities, I later asked for a room without too many stairs, Chatsworth Hotel said that was OK. I explained direct to the Hotel that because of COVID restrictions I would not pay for this booking until I knew that travel by Railway would be unrestricted. They were okay with that also.When the travel restrictions were lifted - on 17th May  I immediately paid  the whole bill, \u00a3440.00 I had been told me that I must pay  by 2nd June. This was okay by me.  This was well before the due date.On the 3rd of June, less than a week before the booking, I received notification that the booking had been cancelled by Bookings.com on the basis that I had not paid the bill before the 2nd of June. The Chatsworth Hotel immediately rebooked the room to somebody else!! Despite having received payment well in advance of our arrival.I of course remonstrated to the Hotel, but they said that they could do nothing! and they had to accept a new booking for what were our dates. After trying to contact Bookings.com (which turned out to be impossible by telephone) I immediately re-contacted the Hotel in a very distressed state-in-deed - I broke down during the telephone conversation (I suffer from a depressive disorder including Anxiety).I called them once again, But they said they could not help me, and the cancellation stood. I immediately requested my money back - which they paid.  I also received a debit of \u00a3412.80 from Bookings.com, but they realised their mistake and deleted my account with that \u00a3412.80 cancelling out the credit.This cancellation was extremely upsetting for us particularly as my Husband has a depressive disorder which includes anxiety.So, I wish to claim from both of them a payment for loss of value and compensation for the distress that was caused by this error on both of their  parts. I claim a total from you in the sum of \u00a3400.00.Section 49 of The Consumer Rights Act 2015 (\u201cthe Act\u201d) implies a term into the contract I entered with you, requiring you to carry out your service with reasonable care and skill. Neither of you bothered to check I had already paid! If you had only checked this - error would never have taken place. This constitutes a failure on both your parts.The problems described above show that you failed in your legal obligations. I therefore have a claim against you for breach of contract.And breaches your own standards laid out in your contract. Please note that liability for substandard performance of the services cannot be restricted or otherwise excluded, pursuant to s.57 of the Act, despite any terms and conditions to the contrary. To be clear, these rights act independently of any guarantee that may or may not have been provided in respect of the works. As a result, I look forward to receiving your reply within the next 14 days from the date of this letter.yours sincerely etc.\"I  sent this letter to both of them by e-mail and registered mail, with a reply date of yesterday. I have not received a reply.I searched the internet and came up with a statement that Bookings had been taken to court for a similar incident and the court found against them. The complaintent has not ever received payment from Booking.com.This seems to me that I am wasting good money after bad by perusing Bookings.Could you advise on this? to continue or not.","review_rating":1,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":2799,"author":"Vali","location":"unknown","date":"2021-07-27T18:18:44.000Z","headline":"tried all day to make a\u2026","review_body":"tried all day to make a booking..impossible..worst site for it","review_rating":1,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":2800,"author":"James Davies","location":"unknown","date":"2021-07-27T17:14:09.000Z","headline":"unbelievably bad experience","review_body":"unbelievably bad experience.

We booked a Queen Room (Booking.com description) with extra living room space and big bathroom -  we were shown to what I would describe as no more than a standard double room that had no extra living space and we said straight away that the room was not what we expected.  We were advised that they could not put us in a bigger room as there was none available and that Booking.com should not have described the room as a Queen Room as it is a signature double (whatever that means).  It was too late to go anywhere else as we had also booked a table in the hotels restaurant and it was my husbands birthday.  The room was so hot with a totally inadequate fan that was blowing warm air into the room and a small skylight window with a fixed blind that we had to keep wide open all night and that meant we could not close the blind so the sun came streaming into the room at dawn.  It was without doubt the worse nights sleep we have ever had and the most uncomfortable night too.  When we complained we were told to contact booking.com who are passing the buck back to the Hotel and we are stuck in the middle.  This is a complaint of a totally unrealistic and false description of the room we thought we were going to be staying in with no one taking any responsibility for our complaint.  I have decided not to book with booking.com again as I would rather deal direct with a hotel if I have a complaint which involves a refund direct from the hotel and not be playing ping pong.","review_rating":1,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":2823,"author":"Mrs Wilson","location":"unknown","date":"2021-07-25T15:59:39.000Z","headline":"Beware","review_body":"Beware. on booking there are two boxes -1) PAY LATER 2)PAY NOW.

We constantly get guests who booked with bogus card details, or where no CCV number was required. It's impossible to take payment from those who don't turn up or leave without paying, and any attempt to resolve this at Booking.com's end is met with disdaine and contempt. I'm regularly told it must be a fault at our end because Booking.com doesn't make mistakes. We get bookings which end up in unallocated rooms, and on one occassion this resulted in a guest being able to book into the hotel despite us being full. Everytime I have to phone customer service to resolve one of the issues above I'm put through to a generic help line, despite supposedly having a personal contact. I have to jump through 20 questions related to my property, only to be put through to an advisor who then tells me I need to speak to the reservations team, and after being transfered I have to answer the same bloody questions, only to be told that for security purposes they will need to ring me back, and on several occassions this just simply hasn't happened, meaning I then have to start the process all over again.

Henceforth, if you choose to use these people, beware they will give you the run around, or at least they have with me and will make excuses and reasons why they need more time to stick to the terms of the contract\/agreements. Honestly your better off taking your chances with searching for another 3rd party to facility any travel arrangements. They make their websites\/app extremely easy to use\/take your money but god forbid you expect the same if\/when the tables are turned.","review_rating":1,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":2886,"author":"raymond jerram","location":"unknown","date":"2021-07-19T18:03:04.000Z","headline":"I have travelled in Britain and several\u2026","review_body":"I have travelled in Britain and several parts of the world over the last 30+ years.

It was my mistake not to pay attention to the refund policy in the first place. I never experienced having to cancel a trip before this event and in Brazil we are entitled to have refunds, regardless of policy. But because I booked through the European platform, the rules were different. During the conversation, Booking.com offered a 50% refund, which at the time I refused and insisted on a full refund because. Once I learned that the rules did not apply in Europe, I reached back to Booking.com to accept the 50% refund and they retracted the offer. It is an extremely frustrating and powerless situation that I don't want anyone else to experience. I lost a substantial amount simply because the person on the other side of the line thought I was not likable. Sure, I was firm in my communication because I believed it was my right to receive the full refund. Lesson learned on my end!But I still want to share my experience here to stress the importance of, first, not booking any non-refundable offer (because this will force them change their business model) and, second, try avoiding Booking.com because you cannot trust their word. So, please, don't use Booking.com when planning your next trip. Try other platforms that are able to put themselves in their customer's shoes.","review_rating":1,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":2889,"author":"Danica Ricks","location":"unknown","date":"2021-07-19T16:33:24.000Z","headline":"I have booked with them in the past but\u2026","review_body":"I have booked with them in the past but I never will again!

I recently booked a flight from Lisbon to Split, Croatia on June 25, 2021, returning to Lisbon from Dubrovnik on July 4, 2021.  I discovered that my return flight from Dubrovnik was changed without my knowledge.  In fact, Gotogate changed the flight to originate from Split instead of Dubrovnik at 6:40 p.m. July 4, stay overnight in Frankfurt and not arrive back in Lisbon until 11:15 a.m. the next day.  Gotogate blamed the changes on \"the airline\".  I emailed Gotogate within an hour stating that the proposed change was unacceptable and offered Iberian Air and Lufthansa Air flights from Dubrovnik leaving and arriving back in Lisbon on July 4.  Gotogate replied that it could not book me on Iberian Air.  Gotogate did offer another flight from Split, not Dubrovnik, at least leaving and arriving the same day in Lisbon on July 4.  I emailed Gotogate asking about the Lufthansa flight from Dubrovnik which Gotogate's previous email did not address.  Gotogate claimed \"change of departure and arrival city is not allowed as per airline schedule change policy\".  Apparently faced with no options, I twice emailed Gotogate confirming the flight from Split which left and arrived in Lisbon the same day.  On June 25, Gotogate emailed me claiming the return flight previously offered was no longer available.  Instead , Gotogate now claimed I could not return to Lisbon until the next day, July 5.  In response, I twice emailed Gotogate cancelling any return flight to Lisbon it may have booked.  I directly reserved a KLM flight from Dubrovnik as originally planned which left and arrived back in Lisbon the same day, July 4.  Gotogate responded that it would refund the unused portion of my return flight, minus a cancellation fee for the return flights which I did not book in the first instance, and that, \"the handling time for your refund will be longer than usual\".   Gotogate's claim that I could not book a return flight from Dubrovnik supposedly due to the airline's policy is of course absurd.  I strongly advise air travelers to use sites like Booking.com to find the least expensive and\/or most convenient flights, and then book such flights directly with the airlines.","review_rating":1,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":2913,"author":"James Adams","location":"unknown","date":"2021-07-16T14:42:01.000Z","headline":"Customer service system is a TRAGEDY","review_body":"If anything goes wrong, the customer support will waste hours\/days of your time with no results.

Do not use!!!I am a young woman travelling alone and used Booking.com as a site I felt I could trust.I booked a hotel in Dubai named \u2018Sea Hotel\u2019 through booking.com. The pictures showed a nice hotel room, highly rated, in my desired location and within my budget. I\u2019d already booked a nice hotel room through booking.com but was moving after my stay came to an end here, as this one would be closer to where I wanted to be. While in the taxi to go to the new hotel, I immediately felt something was off as the taxi driver spent ages circling around a cul de sac. There were no hotels to be seen anywhere.In the end, he dropped me off and I opened the address in my maps, confirming I was indeed at the right address.  The address was taken directly from Booking.com. This was someone\u2019s private property!! Not a hotel in sight!!I proceeded to call the number for the hotel, again taken directly from booking.com & in my confirmation email from booking.com and the hotel. The number was for a sushi restaurant!!Immediately I knew this was a not a real hotel.I was stranded with my luggage in 41 degrees! Feeling very vulnerable in a place I\u2019ve never been before.I called Booking.com and explained to them my situation. They told me to wait for 30 minutes for the hotel to get back to me.I told them I don\u2019t think this is a real hotel? Given the address and number. They agreed!! But I had to wait anyway as it\u2019s their policy.I was on the phone to them for 4 hours! They were extremely unhelpful, as if they\u2019d heard this story before?All they could offer me was to look for another hotel within my budget and location.They suggested hotels that were 20 and 30 minutes away from my location and way more expensive!! Ones that were 4 and 5 star when I was happy with 3 stars. They even suggested the one I just came from!When they suggested ones that were more expensive I asked how am I to pay for this then? I was expecting them to sort out some sort of deal, as this was entirely their fault for listing a fake hotel and taking my money.Instead, they told me to pay the difference! And if I can\u2019t do this then to ask a friend or family member to pay the difference!!It felt like a joke and all they cared about was making the most money out of my situation.I was so upset and crying to them on the phone. They did not care. They kept me on hold for most of the time. Then continued to suggest more hotels through booking.com! I told them I could do that myself? Is there anything else they can do to help?But unfortunately they would not help & told me they can not pay anything on my behalf or pay any difference.I had to make other arrangements.I will never ever use Booking.com again and I strongly advise others not to either!","review_rating":1,"num_like":1,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar1"},{"index":2930,"author":"Keila Silva","location":"unknown","date":"2021-07-15T08:24:28.000Z","headline":"They sold me a booking to a hotel that was closed","review_body":"They sold me a booking to a hotel that was closed down.

In five days they charged my bank account and asked for the $164 cancelation fee. They hang up on me or  when I try to talk to customer service again.

I haven\u2019t received a confirmation code nor a 4 digit number 1 whole month later & still nothing. Luckily when I made the booking I took a screenshot of the booking reference but even just with that I cannot contact them. I contacted them via email which even took forever for them to reply only to be told to contact their 24\/7 contact car hire & was even asked if I\u2019ve got proof I made the booking. Very bad & careless customer service & will definitely not be using them again.

BOOKING itself (the company) cancelled my booking due to an \"extraordinary low price\" that was published by mistake by the owner. When I forgot to cancel a booking within deadline last year there was no possibility to correct my mistake and I lost 700\u20ac, this time I lost the booking at a convenient price for a mistake of the owner.
