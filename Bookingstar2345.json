I was in london for the jubilee celebrations with my husband and two grandchildren for two nights.Our first night was perfect. Sadly the apartment for the second night (different location) was cancelled by our host (I presume he had forgot to raise his price enough for the jubilee weekend) and booking.com offered us a very poorly rated apartment, outside of central london which would have meant we would have struggled to get to the Mall early. The substitute apartment wanted \u00a3700+ \u2018security deposit\u2019 and all the reviews were saying it was a scam and they struggled to get their deposits back.Absolutely disgusting to be abandoned several hundred miles from home with two small, tired children when london is at its busiest. Especially bad when booking.com didn\u2019t even contact me to begin with, they just gave a refund. I struggled with the representative as English was not her first language and her accent made her impossible to understand. She couldn\u2019t seem to comprehend that a refund was not what we needed, we needed another room.The only reason we found out our apartment was cancelled was because I phoned the place to say we were on our way as the children were tired. I was also told I could not have a refund even though I had already received one, as it was non refundable. I removed my debit card details from booking.com now so they will not be getting paid for the substitute room. But I\u2019m still out of pocket and will be forever furious that booking.com thought it was ok to just abandon a family. I used to recommend them, now my advice would be do not book through booking.com because if your host cancels then booking.com will happily refund you and abandon you. I was mistaken in thinking they had some responsibility to find you a suitable alternative.I do realise london was busy, the majority of hotels were booked but\u2026booking.com should have done more to help.","review_rating":2,"num_like":1,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar2345"},{"index":7,"author":"Daniela Argandona Lowe","location":"unknown","date":"2022-06-01T16:06:00.000Z","headline":"Always a good experience.","review_body":"I don't have any complaints with Booking.comIt's been a couple of years where we haven't travelled, due to Covid, but, usually my first place to look for properties is Booking.

I am indifferent to reviews & rarely read other people's. I tell myself I should before booking and after reading reviews here for Booking.com & Hotels.com I certainly will in future. Our first problem came when we arrived at the Holiday Inn Express at Nogales, Arizona. Our party of 6 decided to check in early then go out. When we arrived we were double booked by Booking.com. Apparently they had oversold the rooms allocated to them & we were going to be bounced to a local Best Western. Not the end of the world but we decided 'Sod it, we booked the HIE & we are staying in the HIE. We were told the Booking.com should have advised us ahead of us arriving. The reception were understanding, uncomplimentary about the agent & happily found rooms for us after a bit of negotiation. We moved on from Nogales to Sierra Vista after two days & stayed at the Magnuson Hotel, rated at 8.4. How on earth it got a rating of 8.4 is anyones guess. I rated it as a 2, & my companions thought that was generous. It really was the low point of an otherwise great trip to SE Arizona. It seems both the two big 3rd party booking agents are badly rated at more than 60% cr#p. Doubt I will ever use them again.

Due to flight times and knowing the City would be very busy, we wanted a hotel that had a bar and a restaurant.   On our arrival we asked to eat in the restaurant, only to be informed that the hotel restaurant was closed and only the breakfast service was being provided.   It was obvious that this had been the case for some time as the staff seemed very embarrassed at having to tell arriving guests this.   We then went to get a drink in the hotel bar only to be told that it too was closed.  As there was no lounge for residents we had to go looking for a bar needless to say on a Friday night they were all full and we ended up having to go back to our room.   No minibar drinks except water or juice and only a nespresso machine with very limited choice.  The next day we saw happy hour in the hotel bar advertised in the lift so we planned to go, only to find that evening that the bar was in darkness again.  Staff advised that the bar was closed and had not been open for some time.  Whilst apologetic they could not offer any drinks or even a hot chocolate to guests.    Booking.com advertise this hotel as having a great restaurant and all 4 star facilities it actually was on a par with a 2 star hotel in terms of facilities available.  Booking.com clearly do not verify any of the information provided by their hotels.  This spoiled our break, as we like to have a relaxing drink in a hotel bar at the beginning and\/ or end of an evening and this was not possible.  We would not have selected this hotel had Booking.Com\u2019s advertising been accurate and not so misleading.","review_rating":2,"num_like":1,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar2345"},{"index":28,"author":"Aine Power","location":"unknown","date":"2022-05-09T18:42:16.000Z","headline":"They are quite good if you are not\u2026","review_body":"They are quite good if you are not booking flights with them.I always read the T\/Cs and always have contact with the accommodation at least a week before I book in.

The majority of the bookings have been absolutely fine. In fact I have only had serious problems requiring contact with customer services for two bookings over the years and yet these experiences have left me giving such a poor trust score. How come?The first problem was in 2017 which was a last minute booking for two rooms in a hotel in Sweden. The confirmation email stated that I should pay the hotel in full on arrival. We did that. We discovered later that booking.com had also taken full payment on my credit card (at the point of booking). So I had paid twice - a simple error to resolve I thought, and yet it took 3 weeks of an absurdly extended and frustrating correspondence. The credit card company suggested that I attempt to resolve it directly first, and keep a record along the way, before they would step in. Booking.com doesn't make it easy to download chat exchanges, and I had to take screenshots to capture the evidence.The \"chat\" experience with customer services was beyond frustrating. They started off pretending not to understand the problem then they 'blamed' me suggesting that as I had booked two rooms I should expect to pay double! Then they started asking (repeatedly) for a mass of information (credit card transaction records, emails) that were either unnecessary or in their possession already. Then finally they decided it was the hotel's fault. I contacted the hotel and they arranged a credit within a couple of days and suggested I book directly with them in future.More recently (2022), I booked a hotel in London during which the advertised room rate I selected on the booking.com website was stated to include \"all taxes and charges\". Yet when I scrolled down to click the confirmation button I noticed that the price had increased by an additional \"12.5% V.A.T. (Value Added Tax)\" In my mind this must have been an error, and easily resolvable if not an error then it was clearly a deceptive or misleading advertising practice. The message exchange with customer services followed precisely the same frustrating trajectory as the earlier complaint of years before, going round in circles for weeks.  They undertook a full investigation and concluded (and I have it in writing) that there was no error with the pricing information provided to me during the booking process. Other commentators have mentioned the (lack of) reliability of hotel reviews on the site. Personally, I find the reviews much less helpful than TripAdvisor and so I don't generally read or write them any more. But I have recently written a negative but honest review for a hotel and will be watching carefully to see if it gets deleted. So, I am left with little trust or faith in this company. I no longer use it for research as there are now better alternatives. As a Genius Level 2 member, there might be times in future when booking.com is the cheapest method to book and so I won't be closing my account in a hurry. But I will be watching my credit card transactions live and reading the small print during every booking I make with them in future ... anything to avoid dealing with customer services ever again.","review_rating":2,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar2345"},{"index":65,"author":"Thea Monsion","location":"unknown","date":"2022-04-07T16:26:59.000Z","headline":"Avoid this site and save yourself the trouble","review_body":"I can't even explain how terrible my experience we had.

It's worth noting, I have taken and submitted a screen grab depicting the dates entered on booking.com website. Subsequently, I had received an automatic email with the flight confirmation, customer reference and a pin number, with a return flight set to 20-December-2021 (same day) .After realizing booking.com made an error, I have called them immediately to change the return flight date to, 10-January-2022, as originally entered on booking.com website. While on the telephone, before I could speak or chat online with any of booking.com customer service representatives, I was asked to provide a nine-digit confirmation number, which I was never provided with.My flight reference number was, forty, hyphen, followed by nine numbers. As result, I was Not able to speak with anyone on the phone that day.However, on the same day ( 09-November-2021), after a thorough Google search, I was able to find booking.com customer service email address and contacted them. Unfortunately, my experience with them was less than pleasant. I was passed around from one customer service representative to another, asking me the exact same questions, for hours. In the end, I got nothing resolved. It's also worth noting, I've personally emailed many of their employees I had found on LinkedIn about my incident (including the CEO, Glenn Fogel). And have not heard back from any of them.On the 13-November-2021, I have managed to contact etraveligroup via telephone and email. Etraveligroup is part of booking.com, and deals with flight enquiries.  After providing a thorough account\/evidence of my previous incident with booking.com, a tracking number was created for this case. And was promised to hear back from a manager as soon as possible.On the 20-November-2021, I had decided to call again. One of etraveligroup's customer service representatives(Kirti) escalated the case for me. On 23-November-2021, I have contacted etraveligroup once again, to follow up on the case, and got nowhere with a customer service rep called, Praveen.Finally, I've sent an email to etraveligroup's Chief Customer Officer (Pia Vemmelund) and included the CEO, Mathias Hedlund, and booking.com CEO (Glenn Fogel). Days later, I was contacted by etraveligroup  customer service manager to resolve the problem. After a lot of pushback from them to avoid accountability, they have finally done the honourable thing: Changed my return ticket to 10-January-2022, without charging me a penny for their mistake.

If, however, they feel the agent has let them down then they will certainly write an indignant critical review here on Trustpilot.I\u2019ve used Booking.com for years. I\u2019ve never had anything go wrong. I have, just today, had to cancel a hotel booking which I had made through Booking.com. It took seconds I logged onto my account, opened the trip details, found the Cancel button and clicked and the cancellation has been confirmed by email.Reading the reviews, the most common complaints people make of all mainstream online travel agents are 1. The hotel has no record of our booking. 2. They won\u2019t refund my cancellation. 3. They\u2019ve taken money out of my account. 4. They\u2019ve cancelled my holiday. Main stream travel agents don\u2019t do these things spuriously. It might help inexperienced travellers to know: 1. Hotels don\u2019t receive guest booking lists until the cancellation deadlines have passed. 2. There are always two prices for hotels: cancellable and non-cancellable. If you book non-cancellable then no matter what your personal disaster, no agent will refund your money. That\u2019s what travel insurance is for. 3.

Booking.com say they are also having a hard time contacting the property - might be true but they as a well-established company should have a way to deal with it.)) they email from no-reply address so difficult to have an email conversation. when emailing their customer service address, you get a reply to go to their FAQs on the website. it is a jungle...if you're not price sensitive, better go direct with the providers. or just book with booking.com and take it as an experience but be ready to lower your expectations. i think i will choose to go direct from now on, just to have less hassle and to avoid middlemen.","review_rating":2,"num_like":1,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar2345"},{"index":207,"author":"Faye Deane","location":"unknown","date":"2021-10-07T21:06:27.000Z","headline":"We have just come back from a stay at\u2026","review_body":"We have just come back from a stay at dukes the palm in Dubai booked through booking.com.

However, when we arrived at the hotel it was closed, with a note on the door which seemed to indicate it had gone bankrupt (I can only presume this was what was meant by an 'ongoing maintenance issue'). Booking.com was no help whatsoever - no reply to any of my messages. The upshot of all this is that we  had to spend a fortune on a last-minute hotel in London to replace the entirely fictitious accommodation offered by Booking.com. I am appalled.(Two days later). To add insult to injury, I see that it now says in our reservation, \"No-show: fees waived by property\". This is a blatant and outright lie. We showed up all right, in a taxi, with a considerable amount of luggage, at past ten o'clock in the evening, to find this hotel completely closed down. And still no reply from Booking.com, which appears to have turned into a scam operation.I challenge Booking.com to reply to me below denying my account of what happened.(A few days later). Another point: I spent a long time trying to find a hotel in London which has windows which open fully, because we were very anxious about Covid. The hotel we booked - but never got to stay in - fulfilled this criterion. So the fact that we then had to take a chance on any old hotel, which may or may not have had opening windows, was an additional source of stress.(19 days after the event). Booking.com has now agreed to refund me, which I am of course very pleased about. They have also apologised, which I appreciate. But this was not a good experience - and I did not like the fact that they blamed me for not contacting them, when they were the ones who quite simply ignored my message. Neither did I care for the lies the hotel told (that we were a no-show and they decided to waive the fees - that is simply untrue). In the meantime I wrote to the consumer column of a well-known British newspaper, and I supsect this is not unconnected to Booking.com's agreement to refund me.","review_rating":3,"num_like":1,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar2345"},{"index":247,"author":"Christopher Winstanley","location":"unknown","date":"2021-08-27T20:56:15.000Z","headline":"I've used this site on a few occasions","review_body":"I've used this site on a few occasions.

We recently stayed at a lodge that was lovely, however when we called to ask about accessibility,  we were told that our room was on the ground floor. We assumed because we were asking about wheelchair accessibility that it was therefore accessible but there were in fact 2 approximately 7 inch steps to go up to get into the room. Luckily the hotel staff was amazing, extremely helpful and we were given an upgrade to a room that would be easier to get into, and we carry a ramp with us, in case of these emergencies so we were able to get the chair into the room.Booking.com needs to make wheelchair accessibility as clear as other things,  such as how many beds and towels there are.  20% of the American population are disabled folks.It looks like many of the hotels advertised on Booking.com are not ADA compliant.

I booked an apartment in Leeds and had to cancel for Covid-related reasons.  The host said 'fine, you have credit for another date' but recorded it on Booking.com's system as a 'no-show'. When the other date came, they texted the day before to say the apartment wasn't available because someone there had tested positive and that I would get a refund.  No refund.  The apartment I booked instead was not as described on the site (not enough beds for all of us) and was not clean, no one came to let us in, and the key fob to the building did not work so that if we went out we would not be able to get back in.  I started trying to clean the place, but decided we couldn't stay when I found the fridge full of food. I was promised a refund, but the money has not been refunded.  Booking.com told me on the phone, 'you can't be scammed if you book through us', but I have lost money for two bookings and wasted so much time and effort trying to contact them.  There has been no reply to my messages and the 'contact customer services' link just says to contact the host ie. the person who has scammed me.  That's not a service, that's an abdication of responsibility. I thought they might care about their reputation and want customers to trust them, but on the basis of my most recent experience, that is not so.An update: Booking.com refunded in full for the first booking after I opened a PayPal case.  The host of the second booking finally refunded me after a follow up call from Booking.com - so in the end I didn't lose money.

Earlier this year, I booked a short break for last week, in this country. I can honestly say, it was the most horrible booking experience I have ever had. As the hotel was very nice, I have given 2 stars rather than 1.When I first booked, 4 months ago, I was asked  to notify our arrival time, which I did, via booking.com, and got an acknowledgement. Six minutes later, I was again asked to notify our time of arrival. Below that was a list of behaviour that would not be tolerated - breakages, excessive noise etc.20 minutes later, the same message was repeated with a different check-in time, followed by a long piece about detailed terms of  booking.com and eviivo. Unbelievably, the whole message was then repeated in the same email!! Then the whole lot came again 4 days before our arrival, again asking for arrival time and again repeating the admonitions about bad behaviour.We arrived, paid our bill and got a receipt. I wish I were making this up, because it's so crazy, but 14 minutes after arriving and settling the bill, we got the final request for time of arrival, ticking off for our potential bad behaviour, variable check-in times and the stuff about eviivo. All repeated as previously. If your head is going round, so is mine!I am not identifying the hotel because we had a pleasant, quiet stay and the owners were very nice.

Hard to navigate. Difficult to resolve any issues as you can't speak to anyone. Hotels never email invoices despite always requesting this info via Booking.com, even when you pay via Booking.com you would think Booking.com would be the ones to issue an invoice. No quality control\/checks on hotels that are listed, you could list a box in your back garden and Booking.com would allow. Very hit and miss. If you know the hotel already you can sometimes get some good deals but would never risk an unknown hotel on here as some are very poor ones. Quality of info varies between different listings. Never really sure what type of room you are going to get as what is pictured isn't always what you get where hotels have more than one available - this should be clearer. If you can book a certain room via number or name if you use hotels website you should be able to do the same with Booking.com It's a pity they don't just concentrate on quality hotels\/B&Bs etc whether budget or luxury, rather than any rubbish and listings that are already on AB&B. It doesn't give you much confidence in booking what looks like a nice hotel when there is so much poor quality accommodation on site as well.

Every booking I've made with Booking.com has worked out perfectly (and I've made many!) So I don't understand the negative comments here.

Today 10th February2021 after chasing my Bank discovered I was paid by the Hotel \u00a3617.86.  A deduction of \u00a330.14 was made for Exchange rate.  Normally Hotels DO NOT CHARGE the Card until you arrive at the Hotel and the Visa Card is given to Guarantee Booking.  To my disappointment I was charged by the Hotel 8 Months before my arrival.  I rang Booking.com and spoke to Ian at Customer Services.  My questions were not answered which were as follows:-1.  WHY THE HOTEL CHARGED MY VISA CARD 8 MONTHS BEFORE ARRIVAL DURING PANDAMIC AS ANYTHING COULD HAVE HAPPENED?2.  IT WAS FREE CANCELLATION SO I EXPECT TO BE REFUNDED FULL AMOUNT?3.  WHEN I MADE THE BOOKING IT SAID CLEARLY \"YOU CAN CANCEL LATER, SO LOCK IN THE PRICE TODAY\" which I did?Bearing the above I did NOT get anywhere with Booking.com and when I asked to speak to The Manager.  Manager NEVER came on the phone.  I said to Ian from Booking.com to get the Manager to call me either on my Mobile No. or my Home phone No.  So far NO ONE CALLED ME FROM BOOKING.COM!!!!I have travelled the world and I have NEVER HAD ANY HOTEL CHARGE ME 8 MONTHS BEFORE ARRIVAL!!!!!!  Had I known the Hotel was going to charge me, I would have NEVER BOOKED PENHA LONGA RESORT.  I know Hotels are going through rough times, but that does not mean they can betray Customer Trust.  Also had I known the Hotel was going to charge me 8 months before arrival, I would have NEVER MADE THIS BOOKING AS WE ARE IN OUR 70s AND ALSO DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY OF COVID CAN'T COMIT TO ANYTHING.I was told that this was due to Exchange Rate.  Why have I been put into this Dilema.  Booking.com blamed Exchange Rate which I clearly asked why I was charged.  Surely, you give your Card details to guarantee a Stay and NOT TO BE CHARGED FULL AMOUNT?  So Penha Longa Resort I am Very disappointed.

I had to find another one for the second night and practically my trip ended up not as planned because of booking.com.  The place I initially booked was a fraud, luckily I did not give my card info. to these people.

You could not see the ocean from the room unless you stepped on the balcony and looked sideways. It cost me $100 a night extra to get a real ocean view room. The hotel is at less than 60% occupancy. I understand that there are different tiers of service. I also understand that hotels prefer direct bookings. But they should not punish you for using their partners.

Unfortunately, they have let me down one too many times and I cannot justify using them again.I could write an essay on why I do not recommend them but I\u2019ll try to keep it brief.\u2022 When things go wrong, their customer service is woefully inadequate. It is entirely outsourced to a separate agency (presumably based in India) whose staff have no authority to do anything and seem to exist solely to fob you off. You will never, ever be able to contact anybody who works for booking.com directly.\u2022 Their review and rating system is rigged. Certain establishments are immune from negative reviews and will always be amongst Booking.com\u2019s highest recommended options regardless of what their genuine customer satisfaction rating should be.\u2022 A hotel that anticipates a negative review can effectively block it by marking you down as a no-show. No amount of complaining to Booking.com will get your review published, even if you provide proof of your stay.\u2022 I once had a hotel cancel my reservation on the night of my stay. I tried to check in at 6pm and had been told my room wasn't ready. Three hours later, I received a text message saying my reservation had been cancelled. They had already taken payment weeks in advance, but I was left stranded at 9pm in winter conditions with nowhere to go. Booking.com refused to publish my negative review because I hadn\u2019t actually stayed there. I had to file a credit card chargeback to get my money returned.Some people will tell you to always book directly with a hotel to get the best price. This is most certainly not always true, and sometimes it is better to book through an agency \u2013 however, I strongly recommend that your agency of choice is not Booking.com.

Unfortunately, my friend had to cancel the wedding at the hotel due to COVID, so we tried to cancel our booking with them too.Unfortunately they're unable to cancel and refund my booking, and I think that it's an absolute disgrace and it was only one night for \u00a345.They and Booking.com didn't even reach out to us directly to sort this out. And when we did call them directly, they referred us straight to each other, thus making us go back and forth between them both. And any communication we received from them or Booking.com was generic.I can understand if we booked a room for 1-2 weeks of their hotel, but to not even work with us for a booking of one night? And to not even offer us any other alternatives? It's real disgrace and shows how inflexible and penny-pinching that they both are. This is not acting out of good faith during these hard times.Avoid this hotel and Booking.com at all costs!-- UPDATE 28\/10\/2020 --So my friend finally managed to get a refund off of them after many an argument. I've updated it to no more than 2 stars just for the fact they gave us the refund but it was a far from a smooth process.","review_rating":2,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar2345"},{"index":429,"author":"Shelly","location":"unknown","date":"2020-09-21T10:54:06.000Z","headline":"A must!","review_body":"Has made booking holidays so much easier, finding the best deals throughout the web.

The next day I happened to sign into my Booking.com account, only to see that the booking had been cancelled. I had not received any contact from Booking.com to let me know of the cancellation, it was just lucky I had signed into my account and saw it. I checked my credit card, but everything was fine there. I tried to rebook the property online, but no joy, so I called Booking.com myself. After the staff put me on hold for about 20 minutes, they told me the system had automatically cancelled my booking. They didn't know why, but thought it might have had something to do with my booking history. Not too sure what that means as I haven't had issues with bookings in the past. I asked if they would help me rebook there on the phone. No, they couldn't do that. They could only suggest that I try to rebook using a different account. Strange thing to suggest... I explained what a disappointment this experience was and what a disaster it would have been if I had shown up at the property without a booking, since I had not been made aware of the cancellation. All I got was a \"We're sorry, there's nothing we can do\". I asked for a discount voucher to make up for the mess and stress their \"automatic system\" had caused. Again, \"No, we're sorry, nothing we can do.\" This system of theirs caused quite a problem - which could have ballooned into a much bigger problem had I not been dilligent - and they've just left me to clean up the mess. Booking.com has taken no responsibility to rectify the problem and, frankly, I'm appalled.My advice to you, make damn sure your booking is actually booked, and check on it each day in case they randomly cancel it. Hope that nothing goes wrong, because Booking.com will not help you. Or just steer clear altogether. Airbnb tends to be much more helpful anyway.","review_rating":2,"num_like":1,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar2345"},{"index":436,"author":"Seanie","location":"unknown","date":"2020-09-14T09:28:25.000Z","headline":"The first port-of-call for every trip","review_body":"The first port-of-call for every trip I plan.

More websites should offer this as it becomes very difficult to book rooms during busy periods when you wait and see if you can get it off work etc.Most of my experiences with rooms from booking.com have gone very smoothly. No issues, which is why I gave four stars.BUT I did have one very horrific experience. Me, my sister and our friends went to London for a concert. My sister booked the hotel way in advance. When we turn up on the day, we\u2019re told our room has been double booked. We had no warning, we were in a big city with nowhere to go and all hotels were booked up as it was a popular concert, and we were not offered a nearby alternative like other hotels might. The managers were not there so we had to call them on the phone. When  my sister got upset (not swearing or being rude, just crying and shouting hysterically as we realised we were three young girls stranded), he swore and threatened to call the police if we didn\u2019t leave (we\u2019d arrived at our room before the other people). As we\u2019d planned to charge our phones, they died. We were excited to get ready to see our favourite band but we had to go unshowered and upset. When the concert ended, we walked for a couple of hours stopping at every hotel we could find, willing to pay any price, but they had no rooms. We almost surrendered to sleeping on a park bench until my sister remembered her friend that lived in the city. However, our phones were dead so we had to charge them in a subway, and it took another hour to get a taxi.My first issue with booking.com is they should check the quality and legitimacy of the places they list. We had just come from a couple of hours away, but I know some people had flown into this concert from Scandinavia. We knew someone here, but what if they didn\u2019t? Secondly, we had to pay \u00a330 to store our bags at the venue and around \u00a370 for the Uber. Booking.com customer service at first told us they would refund us for the room but was insistent they would cover nothing else. We called again and another agent said of course they would also cover the extra costs that we wouldn\u2019t have had to pay if our hotel had not cancelled. This is much better, but honestly we should\u2019ve been compensated.","review_rating":4,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar2345"},{"index":491,"author":"Kim","location":"unknown","date":"2020-07-12T15:08:46.000Z","headline":"Just returned from 3 days in the\u2026","review_body":"Just returned from 3 days in the Bloomfield Brew House in Blackpool and I must say the whole stay was excellent.

I used Booking.com to find a number of hotels around Ireland.I found the system easy to use and got a variety of excellently priced hotels\/B&B's around Ireland.About a 6 weeks ago through booking.com, one of the hotels told me they had to cancel the booking due to COVID-19 (it was a B&B and the owner had been told b their doctor that they were vulnerable).  We were fully refunded through Booking.com.A number of weeks later another hotel cancelled our booking.  In anticipation of other cancellations, we decided we needed to cancel our booking and went through Booking.com to do this.  We found the whole sysem on line very easy to use.  We were sent e-mails for each booking saying they would be processed within 7 - 12 days, we actually got the refunds in my bank account within a couple of days.I am new to this trust pilot site and actually came on to complain about how Direct Ferries had handled the cancellation of our ferry booking for this holiday.  I then thought I would visit the section for Booking.com to leave a positive review, as I appreciate we are often quick to complain but rarely compliment when someone does something well.  I was amazed at the rating Booking.com has and the fact that there were a lot of complaints.  I can honestly say:       1.  I find their website easy to use, always find good places to stay at good prices and I  have used it for years.       2.

It wasn\u2018t until I told the property that we would be driving to the UK to take our holiday and will they confirm our reservation is current that they finally agreed to refund our money in full!!  This is quite simply shocking behaviour and not the way we should be treating people at such a difficult time!! We too have lost business and will definitely do so this summer and no doubt next winter, however that does not mean \u201eshaft customers!\u201c My advice to people who are having problems with accommodation refunds is to please be sure to cancel your reservation with an email sent through the booking.com system to the accommodation stating that you are cancelling and giving your travel problem reasons and not \u201cno showing\u201d as this will give you the right of recourse further down the line.

Like everyone else recently due to COVID19 we had to cancel all of our travel plans. We were 1 month into a 3 month trip to Asia and had all our accommodation pre-booked with booking.com. When we had to go home early because of the virus we had at least 12 upcoming trips booked on booking.com which we now couldnt make. A lot of these already had free cancellation policies which were very easy to do online. The others which had cancellation fees were very easy to contact booking.com via their online customer service chat and request free cancellation. We ended up cancelling all of our upcoming trips free of any cancellation costs and getting any prepayments refunded. It was a relatively painless experience, a vast difference from attempting to get flight refunds from airlines.

I paid for one stay and decided to pay for the other when I arrived.Problem is I cant get to the UK because of multi country border closures, restrictions, flight cancellations and quarantines.  When I tried to explain it to the hotel they said they couldnt refund me because I needed to speak to Booking.com.  When I spoke to Booking.com they said they talked to the hotel and the hotel refused to refund me - so there was nothing they could do.  Both seemed to blame the other.Admittedly there was a no cancellation option on the stays but I tried to explain that while I completely accepted that, who could have known there would be a world wide pandemic??  I was asking for some leniency given the extreme situation.I was then offered a credit to use in the next 12 months (at the hotel booked).  Trying to explain that I couldnt get to the UK within 12 months (I would need to pass through 3-4 borders AND covid-19 would need to be gone or a vaccination readily available by May 2021) seemed to fall on deaf ears.There was simply a complete lack of interest or understanding of the current world wide situation and its impact on travelling.In then end my sister and I have had to accept that we would lose approx $2500 - no refunds, no way to use a credit within 12 months.My intention is to delete my account with booking.com and go with another app in the future.I would be reluctant to recommend them and encourage others to be cautious","review_rating":2,"num_like":2,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar2345"},{"index":561,"author":"Mick","location":"unknown","date":"2020-04-24T16:41:31.000Z","headline":"Little profit huge amount of issues.","review_body":"Pocket financial gain, huge amount of issues.You have to prepare yourself.","review_rating":2,"num_like":1,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar2345"},{"index":562,"author":"Milda Scerbinskaite","location":"unknown","date":"2020-04-24T14:56:47.000Z","headline":"So far the best COVID situation\u2026","review_body":"So far the best COVID situation handling I've seen.

However, woe betide you if there is a problem between you and the hotel - they are no where in sight. They love to take their booking fee then simply wash-their-hands of any involvement in 'difficult' situations leaving you to thrash it out with the hotel. Trying to phone them is impossible - I have more chance speaking to Lord Lucan (Brits of a certain age will know this name!). Also, if you book several rooms for a group this is achievable (actually encouraged) on the site. However, if the hotel has different T&Cs for groups there is no way of knowing this until the hotel takes action - ordinarily taking the entire booking amount even if you ticked the boxes to pay upon departure and only use the reserving credit card for a minimal test payment to prove that it is valid. When you have booked several hotels this is a VERY unwelcome surprise.

The last reservation...I had a nice talk with the owner.  Evidently she receives no money until I arrive.  Booking.com has closed their phones to calls due to heavy volume.  They haven't created a call back possibility.  No wait time is allowed.  No queue.  No message other than the call will be ended shortly.Who is holding your money?  Look at your credit card.

Enough is enough.","review_rating":2,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar2345"},{"index":629,"author":"Aaron Green","location":"unknown","date":"2020-02-20T12:06:58.000Z","headline":"BAD COMPLAINTS HANDLING PRACTICES - POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE","review_body":"I recently had my firs very poor experience with Booking.com and have been left out of pocket because of their bad complaints handling practices.I booked a reservation with Tartan Lodge in Glasgow from a Thursday to Sunday and requested check in for 6am Friday morning. I was told by telephone reception that this would be fine that a note would be added to the system to allow for this. However, when I arrived at Tartan Lodge, there was noone available in reception. I waited 30 minutes for someone to come to the reception desk and tried to check in. I was then told by the staff member that I would have to pay extra money to check in due yo the time of arrival. Even after I explained the arrangement made with the telephone staff the day before and the fact that I had paid for the previous night also, the staff member insisted on receiving extra payment. When I refused to pay extra fees, the staff member told me I need to leave and walked off leaving me in the reception area. As a result, I had nowhere to stay after working a night shift and was not able to arrange alternative accommodation until later that afternoon. Since raising this complaint with Tartan Lodge I received no response at all and Booking.com have stated that they are unable to compensate me due to having no response from Tartan Lodge in relation to the specific complaint points made. I escalated my complaint to a manager at Booking.com who told me that I \"dont have a complaint point\" because Tartan Lodge had no confirmed what happened. I explained to the manager at Booking.com that a customer can have a valid complaint point regardless of whether the other party has responded to it. In fact, as a customer service focused platform, Booking.com should be treating customers fairly by ensuring that their accomodation partners such as Tartan Lodge are held to account. Failing a response from the accommodation partner, Booking.com should have resolved the complaint and compensated me as the customer if they truly put their customer's first. In the end, the Booking.com manager simply stated that she was making a \"business decision\" to reject my complaint and would not take it further! This was despite the fact that I had 1. Not received a response to my initial complaint raised with Booking.com and the accommodation partner, 2. Chased Booking.com for updates on my complaint over a period of 3 weeks, 3. Repeating my complaint issue multiple times because Booking.com failed to record accurately the complaint issues being raised, 4. Not had any compensation for being without a place to stay on the morning of the issue or for related costs of travel and arranging alternative accommodation.Overall this was by far the worst experience I have had with any accommodation booked through Booking.com. I've used the service many times and continue to do so out of convenience, but it is disappointing that when it comes to a complaint being raised Booking.com demonstrates very poor practices and a lack of care for the customer experience. Clearly Booking.com are only concerned with earnings from accomodation partners as oppose to those ultimately giving the company its earnings, the customer!","review_rating":2,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar2345"},{"index":630,"author":"SUPPORTHELPLINE +1855485O4O7","location":"unknown","date":"2020-02-19T21:28:56.000Z","headline":"READ MY NAME","review_body":"Terrible customer service when one of their properties did not at all match up with the reality.

Although it's usually cheaper to book directly through the accommodation itself, it's easier to use just one website for all bookings when travelling around. However, I recently had a bad experience with a hotel and left a bad review, which was held back without notifying me. I'm not sure of the reason, the website only says \"This review has been hidden because it doesn't meet our guidelines\" (probably either the fact that I mentioned the accommodation provided me with an Uber chauffeur, which is illegal in that part of the world, or my use of the word '@sshole' in the context of \"there were children sleeping and because I'm not an @sshole, I kept quiet\"). I'm mostly displeased with the fact that Booking censors reviews without notifying the people who left them. I would've liked to have been given the opportunity to censor the word '@sshole', if that was indeed the reason (I'm not sorry about the comment on the Uber, it was the truth). It also makes me wonder if this is how this particular accommodation (and possibly others) has such good reviews?Also, I tried 4 times to call Booking to complain but I don't think there's actually any person behind their customer service phone number.

We booked somewhere convenient to family as we where there for a family celebration. We get told checkin is delayed and had to wait longer. Then got told someone was waiting outside when they weren't. Get into the apartment, no heating, no hot water, no door handle on bathroom, mouldy bathroom floor. Had to book alternative accommodation . Phone the owner, all we get is sorry about that. Then the next day , we started the complaint procedure through booking.com. all looked promising, we had to send photos ,emails and text messages. The accomation owner lied saying we didnt arrive until 11pm.but we have evidence. So thought this will be sorted.

They should check that the hotels are advertising the same hotel where they put the customers in the end. You cannot put nice pictures on the web page of the hotel in booking.com if the hotel in the end is something totally different. This was my review about the hotel:Be careful when you book yourself a room at Green Field Resort Ubud.I was travelling in Bali and wanted to return to Ubud and stay in a nice hotel. I checked the pictures from Green field resort (booking.com) and it looked like one where I would like to stay. It was a close walk from many places, there were nice pools and a restaurant.I arrived to the hotel late and it was dark already. The hotel staff told me they will drive me to my room. I was only looking forward to go to bed as I had travelled all day. When I woke up in the morning I realised that I wasn't in the same hotel or even close to it. It only had a small pool and there was some construction work next to it. There was no restaurant and hardly any people either. I thought I had been scammed.I went to talk about the hotel with the staff and they were understandable and they let me know they can drive me to places if I need to, as the hotel was further away from the main areas of Ubud. They also told me I could use the pool of the other hotel that I had originally booked. I thought I'll try how it worked and stayed. The problems araised as I went to use the pool of the hotel I had originally booked. I went to have some food as well and I later on heard I'm not allowed to use the pool and their services as I wasn't a customer there. How embarrassing. So I left and went back to my hotel. There were problems with the transport as well. I wanted to get a lift to a certain place and they said there's so much traffic and that it's faster to walk (in the heat). So the original plan of me getting transports wasn't true and available. In the end I decided I wanted to change the hotel. This was a scam from the start! The hotel cannot just move people to another hotel in case they don't have enough space and take you to another one you didn't book in the first place. Just be careful when you deal with the hotels in these areas.","review_rating":2,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar2345"},{"index":664,"author":"Mr Keeble","location":"unknown","date":"2020-01-17T23:15:29.000Z","headline":"Hotel De Beek Anno 1410","review_body":"This is a great place to stay in Sint Truiden In Limburg, Belgium.A family run hotel, mum Rita and son Wim are very helpfull.Wonderful rooms each one different.","review_rating":5,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar2345"},{"index":665,"author":"Birmingham Stays","location":"unknown","date":"2020-01-17T19:16:43.000Z","headline":"Fabulous platform for bookings","review_body":"Fabulous platform for bookings, works well for us \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc","review_rating":5,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar2345"},{"index":666,"author":"Julie Betts","location":"unknown","date":"2020-01-17T17:43:39.000Z","headline":"Booked a hotel through this company\u2026","review_body":"Booked a hotel through this company multiple times and mostly been great.

This company offered me a twenty pound voucher off my next booking which I declined. Our stay at sister hotel was awful, apart from staff were lovely, no working shower, room in attic, no off road parking which I was told there was, certainly not on par with what I'd booked. After that have never heard back from them when I stated an apology from the original hotel who were rude would help. So really disappinted with overall experience.

I have been using booking.com for many years and was a genius member and overall things have been ok. But lately I have found that they are not as professional as before and recently I had a very bad experience which will probably make me never to use booking.com again. I will tell you the story now...Over the past 2 weeks I have been fighting with booking.com and the hotel to get reimbursed. To no avail. Here is what happened: through booking.com, I booked a hotel for one night for 28 Nov, 2 twin beds. For my friend and I in Laguna Beach, California.It was a \u2018booking basic\u2019, not refundable, not changeable booking. I also noticed that I can't do a review for this hotel on booking.com!! stupid reallyBooking.com debited my account. We checked in a the hotel on 28 Nov night, and we went to bed and about 1 hour later I was woken up by my friend, she had found bedbugs, we looked in more closely and in the 2 beds there were quite a few bedbugs. We immediately packed and went to reception, the gentleman at reception suggested to take the room next door, not even bothered to come and check the room. We declined and confirmed with him that we wanted a refund, he said ok, no problem and to call again in the morning, that the hotel will do it. We left the hotel and drove back home at night. The next day I called and the hotel staff  told me that because I booked through a website I had to contact the website to arrange refund and that when the website would reach out to hotel to confirm for the reimbursement, they would confirm and approve for refund. I was shocked as the lady from hotel also acknowledged that there were bedbugs in room 201 (we were in room 203) but did not think they had spread!! I told her that my booking was not refundable and that the hotel needed to pay me directly. She told me that she cannot reimburse me as she did not yet received the money from Agoda.. I was surprised why she mentioned Agoda but said that they deal with Agoda only and not booking.com. I said I would contact booking.com and come back to her. I contacted booking.com and they said that as it was a booking basic reservation they cannot do anything and cannot process any refund and that the hotel needs to reimburse me directly. I called the hotel again but they insisted that they did not yet receive the money from the hotel website so could not do anything. At this stage I was already furious. I then called Agoda but they told me that as I made the booking through booking.com they cannot help me and will not help me. It kept on going like this for 10 days. I again called the hotel on 10 Dec and they said that they refunded Agoda so now Agoda needs to pay me!!! I called Agoda and again they said that all my queries need to go to booking.com. I called again booking.com and lodged a dispute resolution, and their response is that as it is a non refundable booking and in their systems everything shows ok, there is nothing they can do and that only the hotel can do something and that they would try to send the hotel an email. It seems the hotel does not want to accept its responsibility and only says .. 'we sent the money back to Agoda this is no longer our problem.. It is Agoda\u2019s problem' We left  the hotel because of bedbugs not because we did not show up or try to cancel the booking.  This is crazy and in the end I am left with my money gone and 10 bedbugs bite. AWFUL EXPERIENCE !NOTA BENE EDIT TO MY INITIAL POSTAfter many more emails and phone calls with Agoda, booking.com and the hotel and more than 5 weeks after, I finally got the refund for the hotel reservation. In the end it ends well but it was a real fight to get there. It restored my confidence in Booking.com and how they are able to listen to customers concern and respond appropriately. The bed bugs bites have also disappeared....","review_rating":4,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar2345"},{"index":705,"author":"Lilia","location":"unknown","date":"2019-12-12T16:58:14.000Z","headline":"Good for hotels I think","review_body":"I admit I NEVER book apartments through booking.com because I heard some horror stories from friends, plus I prefer to have direct contact with the owner and ask questions beforehand, like one can on Airbnb.

I have never had an issue (touch wood), plus I like that one can at least through online service contact the hotel, and pose questions and special requests. They always respond. Few months ago I downloaded their app, it also makes managing bookings a breeze. Their new feature where if you book a hotel or a city, it gives you an option to extend your stay to nearby cities, is also fun, something other online hotel booking services don't do. They price match, I experienced that, so if you book well ahead, and find same room cheaper later at some other site, they will make it the same.

I booked a hotel in Philadelphia near the Wells Fargo center to see Elton John through booking.com. When I arrived it was a run down nightmare. No real parking and I had to create a space. When I told the front desk about it...she said that they rent out to the airport and it is just first come first serve. This is the first of the horrors. The elevator was out of commission and we had to use a service elevator. The whole hotel smelled of cigarette smoke. There were no towels in the room and when we opened the lid to the toilet...there was feces and excrement everywhere. We tried to flush it with my foot. No running water. We left immediately. I called booking .com the next day after driving home late after the concert. They were lovely and took the information. I made it clear we did not get pictures. For the next week...I got several emails from Booking .com asking for proof(pictures). Finally I spoke with a rep who said that the hotel denied it all. Booking offered me 27 dollars for a 140.00 room I never stayed in. I let Booking .com know that they are promoting an unsafe and unsanitary hotel. I asked if they checked this place out ever. The Rep said \"no\". I told them to keep their 27.00 dollars and to stand behind their promotions. I'm out 140.00 dollars and they will keep promoting the PENN ROSE HOTEL IN PHILADELPHIA. I will use a different company from now on.","review_rating":2,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar2345"},{"index":721,"author":"Ben","location":"unknown","date":"2019-11-21T09:05:14.000Z","headline":"Surprised to see all the bad reviews","review_body":"I'm surprised to see all the bad reviews here.

As it was said by son of the owner that his father in a hospital with heart attack and during several days they canceled all reservation from the guests and let Booking know that they couldn't accept guests. I don't know why Booking.com still had that accommodation available on website and didn't close it. We were not the firs guests who came and found that there is no owner at the place. I called to support, because there are no option to solve that issue through application. I was waiting more than 10 minutes to speak with support through the international roaming which cost me a lot. Support didn't call me back since they sent last official request to the owner. How Booking.com helped me when I called them back again and waited another 5 minutes? They just cancelled first reservation  send us just nearest location with 1,5 higher price and didn't reply on the email I sent them after reservation.At the end we spent more than 2 hour to communicate with Booking.com and find another place to stay, we haven't seen sunset and spent evening in bad mood.In other worlds I could solve that problem faster myself without calling to support. I could make it faster, without additional expenses on international roaming and found cheaper place with same condition as they advice.The only thing why I did what I did is that I tried to follow official procedures of Booking.com, but it looks like I just waste my time.And the main question is: what support of Booking.com made for?","review_rating":2,"num_like":1,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar2345"},{"index":778,"author":"Florence Cannon","location":"unknown","date":"2019-09-23T17:29:16.000Z","headline":"Real, human customer service 10\/10","review_body":"Honestly, absolutely blown away by the customer service at booking.com.

Our flight to Columbo airport was on the 22nd, the morning of the day after the terrorist bombings that struck the city. We immediately called the airline to cancel our flights and there were no questions asked. Immediate refund with no charge. We then called booking.com and they said they would inform the hotel. To cut a long story short, emails and messages back and forth to the Manager and the outcome was they were not willing to refund us, even though the arrival airport city was in complete chaos and the Foreign Office had advised no traveling to Sri Lanka. After much discussion the hotel said they could give us a holiday voucher to use within one year. Booking.com told them that would not be acceptable as we would obviously be taking another vacation and use our vacation budget on that! it was quite unbelievable that the hotel was insisting that they would not refund us after the bombings. Booking.com called me a few times and they were so helpful, I was actually overwhelmed by their total empathy towards us and wish I could remember the names of the staff members who called me. Anyway...long short of it, Booking.com refunded us in full and with no cancelation charge, so we did not lose one penny! Thank you so much booking.com for relieving our anxiety and being so helpful and understanding of the whole horrific situation. In a time when people were killed and injured, I cannot understand how a hotel can be more concerned about taking money from people who could not come and profiting from this horrific tragedy. But booking.com did the exact opposite and made sure the right thing was done.Confirmation number: 2147234076","review_rating":5,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar2345"},{"index":811,"author":"Sara","location":"unknown","date":"2019-08-19T04:57:49.000Z","headline":"Easiest way to travel!","review_body":"Easiest way to travel!

So...they don't look after the guest either!!  And they CERTAINLY don't look after us, as an accommodation provider.  Won't go into a long winded story and will keep this brief.  They have a huge monopoly over search engines such as Google, they can afford to pay vast sums of money to be the first to come up on the landing pages of Google, Yahoo etc so the small establishment does not stand a chance. They use your listing to list with various companies so the independents have no control over the content.  They won't let us list our properties how we want them, they are described in `corporate' style which is not an accurate way to list the establishments who list with them.They have affiliate partners such as Agoda and TripAdvisor and heaven help you dealing with Agoda (Tripadvisor have actually always been really helpful).  Agoda `pulled' our information off booking.com and despite the fact that our booking.com listing says we do not allow children or extra beds in any of our rooms, the Agoda listing says all children welcome!!  Various automated emails to both booking.com and Agoda with the same old nonsense and no-one getting back to us to rectify a simple sentence.  We have NO control over our own business listing.  It is truly appalling way to treat accommodation providers who are their customers!We have also had numerous battles with them regarding letting guests request check-ins outside our hours on reservation (pull down list allows this) - there is a reason why we stipulate the hours we do.  No end of hassle having to get in touch with the guest and explaining this, it is not fair to the guest or us.As many people have reviewed on here - do not deal with them or any of the on-line travel agencies, they charge us 15% + commission on every single nights bookings.  If you want hassle-free booking, then deal with the accommodation direct!!  Speak to the organ grinder as opposed to the monkey!  You will save yourselves money, save the provider ridiculous commission charges and being able to speak to a human being!

Customer service and hospitality sadly lacking, staff very busy, being busy but do not go out of their way to ask if you need or require any thing else. I should add that we are British and would have expected overseas visitors to be looked after better, it would appear that this is an Italian Hotel for Italians. What a palava the procurement of the sunbeds was, we had booked two sunbeds and a sun canopy for 5 days at a cost of 40 euros per day by email prior to our arrival, assured that it would be no problem, however, whilst asking for 2 towels and the route to access the sunbeds we were Informed that it was 'not possible' if we were not given a receipt upon check in and that was quite simply that. Not what you expect to hear given the fact that there is no swimming pool, the terrace to our room was tiny with no loungers and the public beach is non existent. Getting the reception staff to understand that we had communicated previously via email to confirm wa' trying' to say the least, they were very dismissive and not helpful. Eventually the penny dropped and another reception lady who actually bothered to check the emails saved the day. No apology, nothing.I feel I should mention 3 very pleasant members of staff, the barman, the young lady at the Spa and the night porter, all very personable and happy to help, not a huge number given the capacity of this hotel! We have stayed in many 4 and 5 star hotels over the years all over the world but can not see how this hotel has earned its ratings, the public areas are pleasant enough but the rooms are basic, clean, but that should be a given. Breakfast was limited and once provided with a tea or a coffee we were never approached again, we had to ask, simply not good customer service.

Two days before our departure, Booking.com called to tell us the property owner cancelled our reservation. (Wait, what? They can do that?) They presented another property to us that they said was \"comparable\". We didn't know any better because we were unfamiliar with Barcelona, and it was such short notice, we didn't feel we had any choice but to trust Booking.com and accept their suggestion. So they booked the new place for us. Once we had a chance to review the new place and research options, we discovered that, yes, the new place was similar in size, beds and price, but it was WAY farther away from the location we were in originally. So, in Booking.com's eyes, replacing a property in Manhattan with one in the Bronx is totally \"comparable\". When we called back to change it to another we found that was actually more comparable, Booking.com said it was such short notice that we couldn't cancel or it would be non-refundable. So, beware, number 1, your property owner can cancel on you and, number 2, Booking.com won't do a thing to actually help you. They will simply do whatever it takes to keep a booking. They are simply a middle-man for bookings and take no responsibility for their property owners and push all risk onto the consumer.

They said it was fine and the owner would see that I selected the time I had.We arrived in France, Amien at the time stated. No one there. Waited 15 mins and as was with my family (three young children) phoned Booking.com.  I'd already trying repeatedly calling the properties phone number with no response.When I got through to an advisor they had to check with the property, and obviously couldn't get through.  So they said they would send an email and if nothing heard in 30 mins they would ring me back.  After 40 mins nothing heard so I called them again (was on hold again for 5-10 mins).The person I spoke to said OK, they would find us alternative accommodation and that the previous person should have called back, don't know why they hadn't.  The woman I spoke to on the phone said she would personally look at alternative accommodation and email me with some options and call me back. 30 mins later I'd heard nothing at all, despite he assurance she would!My wife called the next time and said to the advisor that we wanted some new accommodation booked while on the phone. This seemed to work!So after 2 hours of phone calls and waiting around we finally had alternative accommodation, even though we had to do the booking!  Why couldn't Booking.com have done that?We have 3 young kids, 2, 5 and 8 years old.Be aware people if the accommodation is legit then all is good, our second booking in Paris was without fault!  If there are any issues you have to wait around trying to call them because they do not call you back!  Do any companies actually call back?  They all seem to promise it and don't.P.s.

Unknown to us at the time, the advert contained several inaccuracies. For example, the address given and description of facilities were incorrect. In addition, although the advert stated \"we speak your language\" and was in English the owner did not speak English. Luckily, once we had reached Locarno I found common ground with French so the Italian speaking owner could direct me on the phone until I found the correct address. Imagine if we did not speak some French. She was apologetic and said she had several times contacted booking.com to correct the inaccuracies but they had not done so. At the end of my stay, booking.com sent me a link to review the accomodation. There were two separate text boxes to fill, one for what was most liked and one for what was least liked. They then published only the \"most liked\" feedback next to the advert for the same accomodation. Allowing room for error, I am inclined to think booking.com falls short in areas of due diligence (i.e. checks with owner that all details are accurate and correct), quality of service, client focus and perhaps also on business ethics.","review_rating":2,"num_like":1,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar2345"},{"index":881,"author":"Will","location":"unknown","date":"2019-05-25T10:49:03.000Z","headline":"Good Customer Service","review_body":"I booked a hotel for 5 nights.

At the front desk they had no idea about us, and they just needed  the apt number to enter into the system to check the reservation. We called and texted the contact\u2019s phone number for 1 hour. No answer. We called booking.com, they try reaching the person in charge of the apt. And she demanded us to pay a usd 300 deposit in order to give us the apt number. She started texting us privatly, insultating us, threatening us to pay the deposit urgently, telling us that she was entering our info into the system. We contacted booking.com again. Being 5PM we\u2019ve been kicked out of the building for not having the apt number and check our reservation. Booking.com was acting as a mediator between us, the client who al ready payed the Full Price for 5 nights, and the accommodation, who was threating us though whatsupp and not giving any information. Booking.com finally got the apt number, we went back to the bulding\u2019s front desk and when se say \u201cApt 619\u201d they tell us that that apt is empty, they\u2019ve been kicked out because of a serious infringement. That is to say, the accommodation for which we payed through booking did not exist. Being 6PM we were still at the streets with our luggage demanding for a refund and a solution to booking.com. They were kind and tryed looking us a hotel but it was very far away. At 8PM, after 5 hours of calling, woring, not having any place to stay after we payed everything, we\u2019ve been told by booking.com that they we could make another reservation in a hotel 6 blocks away, and once we check out and got the payment receive, they were going to refund us only the difference between the amount we payed for the fake \u201capartment sunshine miami\u201d and the accommodation we are staying now.

But one thing that REALLY annoys me is how they transact between currencies. I am in the UK and I have Pounds Sterling selected as my currency. However, transaction are generally made in Euros which means the sum you think you are paying, or that was advertised to you as paying in your home currency, isn't necessarily what you will end up paying (and this isn't made clear).However, recently I received an offer in the post. Book a \u00a3175+ trip and receive a \u00a345 refund. By luck, I was considering a few days away anyway, so we chose a hotel we'd previously stay at, advertised just above the \u00a3175. We took the trip and came home and after 2 weeks still hadn't had the refund. So, I raised a ticket via their system. I didn't get a response. So, after another 5 days I called them. They claimed my trip actually cost \u00a3166, below the \u00a3175 threshold. But, that wasn't the price that the trip was sold to me at, and it's their inter-currency transaction that forced me below the rate they stated I'd pay, which in turn meant the refund, which was greater than the discounted rate, wouldn't be paid.In fairness, they said they'd refund this as 'a goodwill gesture', but the call operator was a bit thick and couldn't comprehend how exchange rates or currencies worked and my frustration wan't understood. I'll await the outcome of this to see if I actually receive the refund. A frustrating waste of my time and arguably misleading at best.","review_rating":2,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar2345"},{"index":926,"author":"Chris Faran","location":"unknown","date":"2019-03-11T03:44:14.000Z","headline":"When I arrived at my hotel","review_body":"When I arrived at my hotel, the booking couldn't be found.

The food court is the worst of all, especially the conduct of the two chefs who I won't name personally, they failed to interact appropriately with guests and cater to their needs. There were many occasions when supervisors had to be called as a result of ordering issues and you would think that there would be no further issues, but I'm afraid not and it was as if the chefs did not care for the guests satisfaction.

We sent them a message explaining the situation and they said is ok, we will pay by cash on our arrival, the only thing that was important was to inform them about our time of arrival.And so we did, we announced them our exact time of arrival, using Google Maps estimations (we traveled by car), and just with 2 hours before we entered Vienna they told us no one will be there at that time to collect our money (16:00) and that we need to pay by card (online) before check in if we want the acces codes to the building. We told them that we don't have money on the credit card, and it was the only card available, and asked if we can pay later, or if anyone can come later that day to collect the money, or maybe we can give the money to someone else.They said the it is our fault that we didn't complied to the rules (even if we discussed about thins previously through the message platform provided by booking) and now we can't check in.I must say that in the last 4 years since I used booking, this situation never happened.We panicked a little, we were on the highway, it was already dark,  and since the property did not provided any solution we thaught the only thing to do was to cancel and try to find another place to stay. The property didn't replyed ay further after that.Arround 18:00 we managed to find another booking, but when we arrived there they told us that the parking was full, and one hour later we managed to find another hotel, also through Booking.com, more expensive that the first one, but we were happy we could find anything.We were not upset about the entire situation, we only wanted to enjoy the rest of the trip, so we forgot about it by the time we came back home.The unpleasant situation happened on 14 january 2019, when my credit card was charged by Steiner Residences Vienna Augarten, for the full amount of the booking. I tryed to talk to them asking why they did that and they sayd they were protected by their cancelation policy.I submitted a complaint to booking customer service, providing the entire conversation between me and the property, and they simply agreed to the same coclusion, that they have a cancellation policy and I have to pay.If it was my fault, I would not have been so filled with frustration, but the property not only put us in a dificult situation by making us find another accomodation on the last minute, but they also charged us for canceling, even if they made it impossible for us to be able to check-in.I am just wandering, who is protecting the customers in this kind of situations since booking.com didn't even bother to read the conversations I have sent them.","review_rating":2,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar2345"},{"index":958,"author":"Jack Haslett","location":"unknown","date":"2019-01-20T09:23:28.000Z","headline":"GREAT STAY!!

But it was actually on the noisy side of Lennox Hill.  E70th and 1st. Definitely not the same neighborhood. And a long distance to our friends with significant taxi costs. I realized after reading the client reviews that the owner was known for playing that trick, luring clients with properties allegedly located in prestigious neighborhoods for which they payed significant prices (1'600US$ for 4 nights), and sending them to very average locations.I filed a complaint, insisting that I was not demanding any compensation but, being a very frequent user of Booking.com, I wanted assurances that this wuld not happen again. I also expected that they would force the owner to change his description.The description is still up there on the web.  \"Nice apartment in the heart of the Upper East Side\". Other clients will be tricked.  Booking.com does not care about objective, transparent, reliable information.  It wants to sell and will publish misleading property descriptions and will maintain it even when clients complain.Booking.com did write back, offering a 25$ handout in compensation, which I rejected.I do recommend that you try and book through other sites when you can.

Booking.com has somehow managed to variously send the incorrect email, passport details, nationality, credit card information for my bookings  to hotels, leading to a great deal of confusion at checkin. This is a real.breach of privacy for the people whose details were mixed up with my booking,  as well as extremely unprofessional and  inconvenient on the part of Booking.com.3. Defaulting from single person to 2-adult booking: this is particularly annoying in countries where pricing is per head.rather than per.room. Some smaller hotels got quite angry when I turned up alone, so in the end I had to resort to emailing the hotels AFTER making the booking, to.ensure they knew this.was actually one adult booking, as Booking.com consistently defaulted my booking to '2 adults.It is a pity that the quality of this site has deteriorated so much. It was a great place to book accommodation, but not anymore.","review_rating":2,"num_like":1,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar2345"},{"index":970,"author":"Yuliya Kliauchenia","location":"unknown","date":"2019-01-03T06:08:49.000Z","headline":"I've been using this company for my\u2026","review_body":"I've been using this company for my holidays for many years.

I then got an email to say that the owner had agreed a full refund and Booking.com would send it on to me and get the money back from the owner, unless I wanted to claim it from the owner myself (why would l I when I paid Booking.com).It is now November and still no refund. I wrote again and got an email stating I would have to claim directly from the owner, even though I had forwarded the email from them stating that they would pay me.

Our holidaywas as good as it always is and the familiarity only makes the experience sweeter. Having explored Cyprus extensively over 24 years we know the island well, and our main reason for staying at Konnos Bay Hotel Apartments is that of relaxing in a perfect (for us) environment. We always have the same apartment overlooking the beautiful bay. and we swim in the crystal clear waters twice a day (morning and afternoon) for at least an hour or more on each occasion. For those who want a more active time, Mike's Water Sports offers a complete range of activities, with safety as the prine consideration.We have made many Cypriot friends over the years, amonst them the manager Adamandini ably supported by Tsonga. The care and attention and support from Adamandini is second to none, and she will solve any problem which may arise, again ably supported by Tsonga. It is not just us who gets this support, although we are made to feel special, Adamandini makes every guest feel special. There were small improvements this year, with new beds and mattresses, but the same feeling of contentment made the holiday as special as it always is. Perhaps what makes Konnos Bay special for us is the wonderful view of the bay, and, even the walk down from our apartment to the beach in the rural settings. We spend a lot of time just relaxing on our balcony, reading lots of books, swimming in the crystal clear warm sea. The rooms have a kettle, a toaster and a microwave (the microwave is a welcome recent addition. We usually have breakfast in our apartment and generally eat out every evening. This year we discovered a new restaurant in Protars (Island Affair) and it has become our favourate (I have posted a seperate review of this restaurant). I should say that Pirillis restaurant at Konnos Bay has greaty inoroved, and can also be recommended.We always have a car, which generally we use only for going oput in the evenings and shopping at the quite large Lidl store for basics such as milk, water, etc but they do have an excellent selection of wine, spirits, etc. We rent our car from Windmills Car Rental in Protaras, and I have previously posted a review on that service, which is excellent value and totally reliable. Having said that, for those who do not want a car, there is an excellent bus service right outside Konnos Bay Hotel Apartment, and very cheap,I would strongly recommend Konnos Bay Hotel Apartmens for a totally relaxing holiday, more so, but different, from staying in a five star hotel! Will we be returning to Konnos Bay in 2019? Well I will be 84 and my wife 79, so,\"God willing, we will!Show lessRoom Tip: Choose a view with sea view,\u2022\tStayed: September 2018, travelled as a coupleo\tRoomso\tCleanlinesso\tServiceAsk ProfTerry about Konnos Bay Hotel Apartments","review_rating":5,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar2345"},{"index":1015,"author":"Mia Cookie","location":"unknown","date":"2018-10-29T07:54:57.000Z","headline":"Some nice experience","review_body":"I have some good practice with the website.

I called up the hotel and the extremely rude person there told me that non-cancellation bookings get charged before arrival with no option to pay upon arrival. I asked her why this is provided to the customer as an option on booking.com and she told me it wasn't her problem and to go to booking.I phoned booking.com who told me this is always the case... strange that its not written anywhere (apparently its hidden on there somewhere if you hover over an icon near room rates section but definitely not clearly stated anywhere) and if you are not allowed to pay upon arrival why provide people with this option when confirming their non-cancellation booking?","review_rating":2,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar2345"},{"index":1021,"author":"Sarah Lavin","location":"unknown","date":"2018-10-21T17:29:33.000Z","headline":"Very convenient and good for comparing\u2026","review_body":"Very convenient and good for comparing prices.

Also if you have a conflict with a property ( or they try to overcharge you almost double ) booking.com will just state that they are only the intermediary, and not responsible for anything. They also refuse to delist fraudulent properties from their site. The property in question is Sea View Apartment in Down Town, 7 Sofiivs'ka Street in Odessa, which is a a fraudulent listing, offering a price way under market value. On the spot they will ask for much more, or refuse you to stay there. If you try to complain to the owner he will simply stop picking up the phone.

They just said oh well try and find something else as we haven't charged you yet!. This time however was different. I booked a room in a hotel (I thought) for a week in Miami. When the confirmation came through it turns out it was holiday let inside a hotel but was not part of the hotel. We were able to use the facilities at the hotel but the room was basic and there were no services offered by the hotel during our stay. We did feel like we were second class and it was a little embarrassing. The confirmation was clear when it came and the correspondence from the owners of the holiday let was excellent. The room was good as a base but wasn't as we thought it would be. I wouldn't go out of my to book with booking.com as I do find their customer service and support the worst ever but have given 3 stars as my experience was good this time but the way the room was advertised was very misleading. I did contact them about this but as you can guess I had no response.

Also, transfer price indication must be on the site, so that no need to contact the service provider.  A lot of improvement is needed, especially now there are many other websites available.

I have been using booking.com for over 1 year now and made a few bookings with them. All went well until my last experience. I booked a house for Christmas in Austria. When I looked it online I have noticed that the same house was cheaper on Airbnb with about 150\u20ac. Because I don't like to change service providers and conditioned by the fact that on their website says they do price match I booked it on booking.com knowing that I will get the difference back. On both websites were the same dates, same no of people and same house. When I called booking.com to get my difference I spoke to a really nice lad who, after checking with his manager informed me that I will not get the difference back as the cancellation terms were not completely identical with the ones from Booking.com. I told them I am not interested in the cancellation policy as I am not canceling a property with them, I am booking one for which I was promissed a price matche. And for the purpose of the argument, the difference on Airbnb is that if you cancel the booking you dont get refunded their fees but you get back the rest of the amount. I feel that I was mislead by their false advertising and I am considering to close my account with them as I cant see how I can trust them anymore. I am curious if someone will answer to this or do something about it. Hope this is useful for others. If something changes I will keep you posted. CheersI wanted to edit this review because I promised I will get back with an update. Booking.com came back to their senses and offered me the price match. Even if I don't appreciate the hassle of having to go through this I have to give it to them in the end and say they were fair, eventually. So I will stick with them, as they are pretty good in general.","review_rating":4,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar2345"},{"index":1056,"author":"Kathleen Russo","location":"unknown","date":"2018-09-01T17:31:09.000Z","headline":"Thank you Booking.com","review_body":"Had problem with cancellation policy regarding Venice hotel booking.

However we turned up at our Plitvice Lakes guesthouse and found we only had 3 rooms (2 triples and a double) instead of 4 (3 doubles and a triple), for 9 people. The guesthouse manager insisted that he had informed bookings.com that he only had 3 rooms available. We showed him the bookings.com confirmation with 4 rooms, and then called bookings.com in UK. \"Jason\" said he'd call back within 40 minutes, with alternative accommodation, but never did.

He offered a Euros50 so we emailed bookings.com to say we may have a resolution, and could they call us back. No call.Then things turned ugly with the hotel manager when I explained that the 50 euros discount should be applied to the room prices he was offering, and not the original booking of 4 rooms. This meant our reduction was only 50 euros instead of 100 Euros. The manager told us to take the deal he offered or leave. We didnt have much option as bookings.com had not replied\/called, and we had next to zero chance of finding another place nearby on our own in peak season. So in the end we reluctantly accepted that we'd stay in 3 rooms.Then followed a series of emails to bookings.com, with replies which were based on incorrect details provided by the manager to them (at one time saying that we had left and were not even staying at the place!).My group and I were very disappointed with our experience.

Booking.com really made a bad situation (which wasn\u2019t their fault) into an amazing one. I booked somewhere in Vancouver for 4 nights, really nice apartment in good location and for my budget, was so happy, but then a few days later I\u2019d had the reservation cancelled.. the host said something about the dates not being correct, and place not available. As Vancouver was selling out fast, and that being the only decent place left within budget, I was extremely upset, now having to find a new place. So I decided to call the helpline to see if they were allowed to cancel like that, (I\u2019d have been penalised if I\u2019d done it) their helpline is always open, another great thing about booking.com and staff always helpful. They told me no, they weren\u2019t aloud to and if I\u2019d like to find another place of the same facilities, they would reimburse me any extra costs. The first recommendation was not great, a 2 star, no parking etc so I found a place very similar to original booking but was \u00a3200 more. Anyway after I stayed at the new, amazing lovely place in replacement of original, I tell booking.com that I\u2019ve stayed (could only get refund of difference after I stayed so yes, I did have to pay the extra up front) but 2 days later, the refund is in my account, pain free no hassle, exactly what they said they\u2019d do. I\u2019d read small print and followed instructions like they asked (to get refund) I see most negative experiences are down to people not reading small print. Amazing. I\u2019m so grateful, the new place was better than original and it just made the whole thing extra special knowing I\u2019d get some money back.

Experience was not altogether bad - but the sink in the communal kitchen was blocked, and there was no toilet rolls in the bathroom, and not supplied even when requested. I accordingly left a mixed feedback, to which the host, rather than responding to my feedback at booking.com sent a message to my mobile directly \"Excuse me but where on our ad did i tell you we have house keeping?

For general reference, the properties determine and check their classification with their local tourism authorities.\".

For instance whether breakfast is included in the price or whether it is an add on. Also one of the hotels we booked had a swimming pool and spa and we planned to use the pool with our baby.

She recommended that I book quickly because it was the last one available. She also stated that this reservation was going to be more expensive than our original reservation but that booking.com would reimburse me for the difference. In 30 minutes I went from panic to essentially a free upgrade. They have since then emailed me apologizing for the inconvenience, reassuring me that they have cancelled my initial reservation without any fees, and that they will reimburse me for the extra expenses at this new hotel.

I then went on a Live Aboard in Raja Ampat, without internet connection until I got to the hotel.

The hotel then went on to take money from me after I had left, without me authorizing the payment. Booking.com did only sent automated e-mails as an answer to my attempt to solve this until I finally got to call them, both people I spoke to, in Indonesia and home in England where friendly and helpful, but their e-mail customer service whom I was limited to during my travels is an absolute nightmare. I finally was offered 21 pounds from the 38 pounds double charge, which I at this point accepted as I been trying to get help for 2 weeks at that point. Basically I paid for the room I stayed in and 17 pounds for another room I never used and hadn't blocked as I only received one confirmation in my app. The transfer went quick. My advise is, if you have the option, go via hotels.com or Airbnb. Booking.com was always my \"Go To\" but this experience really showed how they do not care and will not refund you for their own glitches in their system.

I always read reviews carefully before booking and I have never found a place radically different from what they have led me to believe. I also always contribute a review. My reservation about booking.com is the amount of money they take from hotels and how difficult they have made it for smaller hotels to survive without being on it. When I have found a place I like in a town I prefer to book with them directly on future visits, but to be honest, many hotels have such terrible websites that they don't make it easy!

Our first hotel cancelled our booking by sending me a message on booking.com saying they didn't have availability and asked me to, cancel. This was dispite receiving confirmation by booking.com. This was on the morning we were due to arrive. 2. As our original hotel cancelled at last minute I had to look that morning for available hotels. We chose one nearby, at a much higher rate, as not much else was available. When we arrived at the second hotel In the afternoon we were told they didn't have a booking for us. They denied we ever booked anything, even though I showed them the confirmation from booking.com. The eventually relocated us to a nearby hotel, but tried to charge us the same price even though the advertised prices were considerably cheaper.3. We booked a hotel through the app. I found a cheaper price online and tried to claim a refund of the difference as they say they have a price match guarantee. However they denied it was a cheaper price despite me sending them a screen shot of the offer I found. When we arrived at the hotel they also had not received our booking.

On their website, I booked a hotel which was advertised as a 4-star hotel, although it doesn't have any stars.In February 2018, I had a business trip to London. I searched for 4-star hotel in the centre. I used the 4-star  filter in Booking.com and sorted the results by ratings. The first hotel in the list was Nadler Victoria Hotel, which I booked. When I arrived at the hotel, I was very disappointed by the situation there. The Nadler Victoria hotel apparently doesn't have a restaurant or a bar or actually, anything except rooms. It is an expensive fancy hostel advertised as a 4-star hotel, which it is not. I shared my concerns with the staff working at the reception desk, and they told me that Nadler Victoria Hotel doesn't have any stars and it is not categorised with the \"stars\" system. There are no stars on the website of the hotel, but there are stars at booking.com, which I find very misleading and false advertising.I wrote to Booking.com Customer Service, and I received a reply after 10 days. The answer was a simple CS template. Later, I received another email from CS, where I was offered 25 euros refund as a compensation for my troubles. This is simply ridiculous. I paid 400 euros for two nights. I would never book this hotel if I knew that it was not a proper 4-star hotel. I was misled by the false information in Booking.com, which they did not correct even when I sent them a complaint. It seems to me that they don't care and they just want their listings to look good in Booking.com.So, I am disappointed that a hotel without any stars is listed as 4-star hotel. I am disappointed that Booking.com did not admit or fixed their mistake. I am disappointed by their compensation proposal, although I used their services (Booking.com, Rentalcars.com, Agoda.com) from at least five years, maybe more.","review_rating":2,"num_like":1,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar2345"},{"index":1194,"author":"Richard","location":"unknown","date":"2018-02-22T20:07:53.000Z","headline":"94 bookings, more than 20 countries, over 7 years, faultless service!","review_body":"I have recently seen this company's rating and was gobsmacked.

Sadly, like many of the reviewers, their service has changed and twice in recent past I have been charged for bookings that were 'pay at property' options (the only way I ever book), and on both occasions it has been hassle to get the money refunded.  So two strikes and you are out, as far as I am concerned, so when this recent charge is refunded, I will stop using Booking.com, and advise others to think very carefully before using this service.It needs to be understood that the suppliers of the hotel services input their information and terms into the Booking.com system, however,  it can't be that 'one size fits all', as a consequence the Terms of Booking vary, and if you  don't read carefully the booking form pages then  you can end up with an immediate charge or pre authorisation you don't expect and only find out after confirmation - a matter I have taken up with Booking.com more than once in recent months - including writing to their CEO Gillian Tans.This is what has happened to me twice in recent months, the last time being December yet I read the detail very carefully, and I only ever book using the option of 'pay at the property'  and I have  still been charged immediately.  The refund, needless to say takes forever, with form filling, and the customer service staff of course  implying  that it is my fault, and I made the mistake...which I haven't in either case.Booking.com does not check their suppliers details in their website, nor their terms of business, I doubt that the people in customer service even understand them.  The booking form us customers see doesn't necessarily reflect what will happen in practice. So in my view the Booking.com system is no longer fit for purpose.I used to recommend it to my friends (without the incentive they offer) however have now stopped, and I wouldn't recommend anyone use it.  Booking.com can no longer be trusted as far as I am concerned.IN REPLY TO THE BOOKING.COM RESPONSE, who seemed to have missed the point, it is still stressful because it is still a current problem.  If you had read my details I always review the hotels I stay in...I have given a lot of feedback, this however does not prevent monies being taken when it should not be taken. Either you have an option to Pay at the Property or you don't.  If your system does work on some and not others then you need to do something about the programming.  At the time of the recent incident I had booked 6 other hotels all in the same period of time, so why do 6 work on my option and 1 doesn't!Additionally I won't be reviewing this particular hotel that has given me a problem because I cancelled the booking and we don't get to review cancelled bookings...hence the problem with the refund, which still has not been repaid!So asking me to give feedback is a bit pointless...I have provided feedback here...will Booking.com take any notice - I doubt it.","review_rating":2,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar2345"},{"index":1223,"author":"Saiful Alam","location":"unknown","date":"2018-01-09T10:23:21.000Z","headline":"very good...no problem so far","review_body":"very good...no problem so far","review_rating":5,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar2345"},{"index":1224,"author":"A Shah","location":"unknown","date":"2018-01-07T02:03:07.000Z","headline":"Read then book","review_body":"Booking .com is wonderful when you take care of the following things :1.

Until this year. The hotel rates are not transparant anymore, with often taxes not included. All their focus is on money grabbing, both from guests and hotels. Their website has become a mess, with lots of useless 'information', just trying to seduce you to book with them. Customer satisfaction is not their first priority anymore. Prices are almost always the highest from all hotel websites, despite the (fake) lowest rate guarantee. And finally their assortment of hotels is going down rapidly, with many hotels not being available, assumingly because their commission for the hotel is insanely high. All in all they have become very arrogant after their initial success.","review_rating":2,"num_like":1,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar2345"},{"index":1252,"author":"IggySchapps15","location":"unknown","date":"2017-11-29T00:23:40.000Z","headline":"I had a very bad experience with them \u2026","review_body":"I had a very bad experience with them just now, I had firmly booked a place months ago for a christmas holiday and now I just got a nonchalant email saying \"oh sorry, we had an issue and sorry the place is no longer available\" which we had firmly reserved. We had an email the week prior that WE can't get out from now on and are liable for all the fees from the date onwards. This clearly doesn't apply to them - the company who couldn't care less about peoples' valuable annual leave and money for a holiday. They then said they would find us a replacement, but all is booked. They got us nothing comparable and in any case we would have had to pay more for something we didn't really like.  You also have to pay upfront if this happens and try claim back which is not ideal. Our initial booking price was half as much as they wanted to charge us now - where are we supposed to get this money from suddenly. It is appalling and I would give it no star or one star barring the customer service people I dealt with on the phone. Everyone was lovely and tried to help.

The cost seemed reasonable and completely in line with a number of other hotels and accomodation in the area for that time. I went through the entire booking process only to find that the eventual cost ended up to be two and a half times what was quoted on the initial \"Price for 2 nights\" page as the accomodation had added a very, very hefty nightly service charge (equivalent to more than the rate that I had been quoted for each night of accomodation) AND a cleaning fee. I only discovered this AFTER payment was taken. As it turns out, the accomodation hadn't correctly added the service charges in to the Booking.com system and hence the price ended up being way, way different to that which was originally quoted.Although this was resolved, this is meant to be a comparison site. Having a price listed for accomodation and then failing to quote the entire cost of the property makes it far more difficult to do a like-for-like cost comparison.","review_rating":3,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar2345"},{"index":1267,"author":"John Adams","location":"unknown","date":"2017-10-31T09:19:58.000Z","headline":"Left us high and dry","review_body":"Booked almost a year in advance for a marathon weekend.

I would rave to everyone about how their customer service would always try to help you, even if you might need to cancel a night outside of policy etc.  Recently, I've had a string of bad experiences with booking.com and have come to realise that the company has drastically changed.  Recent bad experiences include: 1. Misleading and deceptive pricing: I booked an apartment in San Sebastian.  Throughout the booking process, the price was flashed in big numbers with the book now button. I proceeded with the booking and after it confirmed the payment it had added \u20ac50 on for cleaning! When I rang booking.com, after a massive wait on hold they told me that the cleaning fee was advised nearby the price.  Why wouldn't you just include it in the total price you are stating throughout the booking?  If I want to worry about cleaning fees and other hidden fees, then I'd just use AirBnB.  This happened yet again at another property just last week, even though I had looked through the details of the pricing quite thoroughly.  I literally had to dig through my whole reservation and search for where it advised me of the cleaning fee after the owner of the property asked me to pay for it.  Hey Booking.com - not being transparent in your pricing is not going to win you happy customers. In the first instance the guy from customer service was doing his best in fairness and gave me some discount off the cleaning fee but I do still feel cheated. 2. False Advertising & No responsibility taken: I booked a property in a small town in Italy and wanted to make sure I could park nearby to the property as my Mum couldn't walk very far.  Spent time using all the filters to find a place that offered free parking on site etc. Finally booked a place that advertises free parking on site. I call the place as we're nearing and the guy tells me the parking is in the public car park at the entrance to the town and is \u20ac10 per day. Not a big deal, but if I'd factored in the cost of the parking I might have picked a different property who had clearly stated that.  So for me this clearly false advertising. I ring Booking.com to explain the situation, to which the response is \"we are just a platform, the property owner can write whatever they like.  If you want to cancel we will have to call the property to see if they will waive the cancellation fee.\" At this point I'm shocked, since Booking.com should realise that the contract should be invalid because of the false information in the listing. Anyhow, the property accepts the cancellation and all is fine, but they didn't have to according to Booking.com and Booking.com were not willing to stand by the information published on their site. 3. Availability issues: I spent a good hour trying to select a property.  Finally settled on one, booked it then went to bed. 10 minutes later my phone starts buzzing with messages. The owner of the property is sending me WhatsApps saying that she forgot to update her availability with Booking.com and that the property isn't available for that date and I need to cancel. Her cancellation policy would mean I'd have to pay for the night, so I told her no, she would need to ring Booking.com to explain the situation and cancel. She responds that it's too late in the evening but she'll do it in the morning. So now I have to spend the night unsettled about where I'm supposed to sleep the following night because I don't want to book another room without knowing I'm going to get my refund. In the morning, I had another issue (the next one on my list) so have to call Booking.com anyhow. I mention this cancellation by the owner and they have to call her etc to confirm this is the case. They come back to me to confirm and tell me the reason she can't honour the booking is because her toilet is broken. Which is not the case at all since the property owner told me she had overbooked. Maybe not Booking.com's fault because it seems the property owner lied to them for whatever reason but it just looks really bad all round.  Not to mention I used to be able to rely on my bookings through the site, but now it seems I have to worry about whether property owners have updated their availability etc etc.  Again, I might as well be using Air BnB and dealing with individuals directly. Booking.com on this did in fairness handle the cancellation well and offered to pay the difference on alternative accommodation and their customer service was efficient about handling it. Still a lot of back and forth on the phone though to fix the situation. Then once it's all confirmed the woman from the property starts sending me messages again to understand what happened on the phone with Booking.com, if she was in trouble for lying to them etc etc. Quite a hassle. 4. Hidden Charges: The morning after I book a property, as I'm finishing my coffee about to head to the place, I receive an email from the property informing me that they are a holiday apartment and therefore they do not provide sheets and towels, and that if I want sheets and towels I will have to pay a \u20ac40 charge. We were only staying in the place for one night. I ring the place furious - by this point I'm so angry with Booking.com and their deceptive ways of doing business.  The guy is surprisingly nice and says he'll speak to the owner and see what they can do.  Says the reason it isn't mentioned in the listing is that Booking.com doesn't give them anywhere to include this charge. It all works out and he apologises and says they will waive the fee this time, thankfully. I advise Booking.com regardless because, if I wasn't willing to stand up for myself, I would again have been slugged with extra hidden fees. Pricing should be TRANSPARENT. Include your fees in the price advertised. Not in small text.  Not after the fact. The email regarding the extra charges was sent via the Booking.com system and I also advised them of the email. They didn't seem to care, since it was resolved. They shouldn't be allowing these sorts of practices.  I've now had it up to my neck with Booking.com, I'm clearly seeing that I need to find alternatives for my travel because they can no longer be relied up. Most of the time customer service are helpful and polite, so that's at least a plus but I don't want to have to be calling customer service so many times when I'm supposed to be on holidays. I'm also losing money because I have to call the UK line (they seem to give better service than the Italian line). I lost hours trying to fix up the issues, when I should have been lying on the beach. Look for alternative sites. Book with proper hotels. If you want to stay at someone's apartment, try going through AirBnB. At least on their site they are more obvious about not being transparent with the pricing and you expect a mess with the property owners.I would change my mind a be a fan of Booking.com once more if they went back to including all charges in the quoted prices and agreed to stand by the information published in the listings on their site.","review_rating":2,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar2345"},{"index":1293,"author":"Andrea M.","location":"unknown","date":"2017-09-15T08:17:07.000Z","headline":"Incredibilmente affidabile !!!","review_body":"Incredibilmente affidabile !!!","review_rating":5,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar2345"},{"index":1294,"author":"ajgx","location":"unknown","date":"2017-09-14T20:41:06.000Z","headline":"Outstanding customer service is rare these days","review_body":"So generally book through this site due to ease and never even thought about customer service contact.

These ratings are ONLY valid given the number of respondents.  for example, If there are only 3 people replying and they give an 8.9 to a hotel, the rating is virtually meaningless.  As opposed to 350 respondents averaging 8.9 which means a great deal.   IF they no longer list NUMBER OF RESPONDENTS, don't bother noting the overall rating a hotel is given.

As a host I am here to provide accommodations and service and in return earn an income.  It is the property that collects money from the guest, not Booking.com, they simply provide the means of booking.  So if you can't get your money back then it is your review of the property that counts.  People read property reviews, before booking. Double bookings ---  This is my biggest problem.  About 95% of the people in the country where I live, do not show up for reservations, nor do they cancel, and they lie saying they will be there in 2 hours then don't come.   Hence, I don't hold rooms for people more than 2 hours after check-in, unless I have a deposit.  I know my policy causes those of you who are considerate problems, unfortunately the number of inconsiderate people have forced my hand in order that I can achieve the objective of earning a reasonable income.

When i arrived in hotel they tried to charge me with almost 90 Euros. I pointed them the voucher but they didnt care. Hotel manager tried to convince me that its was only the money for lunch. But on voucher it was written that i ve booked a standard room. On the first contact with customer service everything looked fine. A Greek lady show the voucher and told me i was right. On the second phone call communication i had with your phone center after contact with hotel manager things turned upside down. Booking.com told me a mistake happened but even when after my repeating question whos fault is this. I didnt get any answer. On the third phone call i get from Booking.com the customer service admitted that there was a mistake from Booking.com mistake but due to low price i ve booked, i had to accept hotels price or cancel it for free. Even if i wanted to stay on this hotel i wouldnt due to hotel managers treatment. So i would like to thank you Booking.com for only admitting your mistake in words and not in deeds. I ve booked a price , as you say the price is guaranteed, but the price was wrong and i had to pay the difference without even know anything. So thank you Booking.com for almost ruining my stay to Dakar trying to find hotel in the middle of the day while i had meeting in the middle.","review_rating":2,"num_like":0,"language":"en","itemName":"Bookingstar2345"},{"index":1470,"author":"Yefim Raikhinshtein","location":"unknown","date":"2016-12-26T21:56:31.000Z","headline":"Easy, informative, realistic!","review_body":"Many years experience with booking.com.

After I booked the non refundable deal I realised however that payment is not taken by booking.com but by the hotel later on. I will be charged in the hotel currency which means high bank and debit card fees and due to fluctuations in the exchange rate I may have to pay even more in the end. Booking.com is misleading and I won't use it again. I will actually incur around \u00a3350 in additional expenses than the prices quoted by booking.com. Not such a good deal after all.

Booking Confirmation worthless - bounced into inferior room","review_body":"Travelling with a friend in Puglia, she booked a room for our final two nights in Trani. The room we booked had one (real) bed on a mezzanine, a double sofa-bed below, and was visibly light and airy and described as having a balcony. She received an e mail confirmation from booking.com confirming that this was the room we had booked for 2 nights. When we arrived, not only was the place not an actual guest house (as stated in the title) but we were shown into a much inferior room - very little natural light and only one double bed and a fold-up single in the corner, so no physical separation of beds\/privacy at all. The kitchen was tiny and poorly equipped, there was no balcony or external space of any kind, the shower was so tiny you could only sit in it and the shower head had to be held in your hand, and it was a ten-minute walk to a cafe for which we were given a token for breakfast, which consisted of one item from a selection of cakes and one cup of coffee. Apparently somebody had come along with a better offer after our booking was made and was in the room we had booked for 9 nights - effectively we had been bounced - but nowhere on the booking website was there a description of the second room, and if we had seen  an accurate description of the accommodation we were given we would never have booked it. Oh well - these things happen. My friend posted a review, which although not exactly positive was perfectly accurate and objective. We were then both woken the following night after midnight by a volley of irate 'What'sApp' messages from the owner, which were less than welcome. I have sent two e mails to booking.com's customer service section but have had absolutely no response, which I think is disgusting! I will avoid using them again if at all possible.

On July 2nd 2015 I booked an appartment in London for us for five days in October. It was important to us that the price, comfort and location in the Covent Garden area was in place. The booking was confirmed by booking.com the same day without any conditions or mentioning that it had to be reconfirmed. When we arrived with our three children - and five suitcases - by taxi at the confirmed adress in London we called booking.com - to find out that they cancelled our booking 16 hours before by e-mail! They blamed the owner of the estate for overbooking and offered us another appartment in a totally different part of London. As we were stranded in London we saw no other possibility than to accept the other appartment which did not meet our requirements at all. We spent a lot of pointless time moving around on the first day - and travelling by bus and tube the following days due to this unacceptable cancellation. On top of this, three men arrived at our appartment on our last day - they were from Ireland and they had booked the appartment for one night, confirmed by booking.com. Now they found out that the appartment was not available - as we were staying there. Just goes to show you - don't trust a confirmation from booking.com.

I was sent a booking confirmation email and thought all was fine. Booking.com called me very shortly afterwards to let me know that there was a problem with the booking in regards to the number of people in each room . The price quoted and confirmed in my booking was for single occupancy and not double. Feeling confused ,as I had selected the correct number of occupants for each room(2) in the drop down boxes and added the names of the people  in each room in the space provided I asked booking.com to  check the price again. The pricing did not change when the lady at customer services checked twice,putting 2 in each room. There apparently, had been a glitch when I booked and the boxes had apparently reverted to single occupancy ,although from my end I could see that it clearly stated 2 per room! A short while later ,another call to tell  me that the owners at the B&B had questioned the booking because the price was \u00a3147 lower than the amount they charge for 3  nights ,double occupancy. Would I agree to go ahead with the correct pricing from the owners? Well, I didn't think I could afford to, so after an hours thinking time I agreed to pay the final full amount,I didn't want to miss out on my only break for the year and had not been away for several years. The B&B like a cash payment on arrival so I had a little longer to save. Now the surprising bit...a lovely email from booking.com to  tell me that they didn't expect me to pay more than the original price as this wasn't fair. They asked me to send them a receipt after my stay and they would refund me the difference (\u00a3147). I am happy to say that they did,within a week of my stay!!

Booking.com IS the site to use I'm telling you. Especially now that pre-dementia has set in and because of post-concussion syndrome and other physical issues, it is imperative that I have an internet site that is easy accessible, reliable, and more importantly, DOES MOST OF THE WORK FOR ME! All I have to do is click Booking.com in my favourites, and I am on the site that makes all those needs come to me. Honestly, I am a picky, demanding, and overly diligent s.o.b. and I can say without one word of a lie, \"I have NEVER had a problem with any of Booking.com's promises, offers, policies, nothing EVER\", and as you know, I have made approximately 30-40 bookings through the site in the last 4-5 years. If they say it's 20% off, you can be assured they will give it to you with no extra work needed on my behalf. If there's a deal for $55.43 a night, you can be GUARANTEED that's the rate you will get...no ands, ifs, or buts. I have NEVER had to contact Booking.com with even a small issue. The sites on the net need to take lessons from Booking.com as to how to run a customer-pleasing, simple to work with, and exteremely reliable business. I don't even check other sites out because Booking.com IS THAT RELIABLE. Use them, browse them, throw everything at them you see on their pages and I can tell you that you will still get exactly what you need, what you want, and what you like, in exactly the way that you need, want, and like it.

Quick, uncomplicated, so clear, easy to navigate, all the information to hand. The next best thing is if you do mess up in any way they are really helpful on the phone. I stood to lose about 300 GBP over a booking mistake and thankfully Booking.com were able to sort things out with the hotel on my behalf.

Once I had completed the transaction I find that my credit card will be charged in euros, which will now cost me more. I am not happy with this process. If I'm expected to pay in euros then quote prices in euros. So, for me I didn't get best price.
